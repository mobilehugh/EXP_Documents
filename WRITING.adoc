= PROJECT Style Quirks

EXP is the game of technological chaos. It is a sciency fiction traditional role playing game. It is meant to be played at an actual table with real people interacting in person. 
This files in this project are adoc files intended for an antoradocs build to create the webpage http://rules.expgame.com

== Neologisms
EXP has many made up words that impart silliness and point of difference. 
Please use GB and CA spelling.
This has been outlined in CSPELL.

Please use cspell-custom-words.txt located in .vscode in the root directory

here is another list
* Canadian spelling: use "armour" and "defence" (not "armor", "defense").
* Use "lazer" instead of "laser".
* Use "maneuver" instead of "manoeuvre" (clarity over CA/GB norm).
* Use "hi-tech" and "lo-tech" as house neologisms (preferred over "high-tech/low-tech" or "hi tech/lo tech").
* Use "uncombat" (no hyphen) as a house neologism; do not change to "un-combat".
* Use "Sciency Fiction" instead of "science fiction".
* Capitalize and use the named spaces: "Think Space", "Hyper Space", and "Cyber Space".
* Use "hite" for height and "wate" for weight.
* role playing should be role-playing everywhere
* Knite and Anti-Knite are correct capitalization
* Use Kirlian (capitalized) for Kirlian energy, aura, etc.
* exatmo is for exterior to atmosphere and is
* inatmo is for inside atmosphere
* zog is for zero g or zero gravity
* spie is for spy
* earth is referred to as Mundane Terra, it's people mundane Terrans
* she is used instead of he and they. this is a legacy anomaly.
* Sotto and sotto for semi auto usually regarding a weapon
* Flotto and flotto for full auto usually regarding a weapon
* Michael Jackson is the actual name of the artist


== Grammar
Please review for gross grammatical errors.
Ignore style concerns or awkward grammar.
Only point out structural errors and typos please.
I have a huge problem with passive voice, please point out passive voice problems. 

== Game Terms
Capitalize defined EXP mechanics and column names when referenced in prose.

.Capitalize when referring to specific mechanics
* Skilled, Unskilled, Max Roll, Force (as attack table terms)

.Lowercase when generic
* maximum roll (generic phrase), skilled play (non-term usage)

== Typographic Quotes
Authors should use curly/typographic quotes and apostrophes in source files for best output quality.

.Quotes and apostrophes
* Use ’ for apostrophes (expedition’s), not '
* Use “ ” for double quotes, not "
* Use ‘ ’ for single quotes, not '
* Prose only: apply to narrative text meant for readers.
* Exclude markup, code, and identifiers: do not change quotes/apostrophes inside include directives, xrefs/links/URLs, file paths, attribute names/values, code or literal blocks, or IDs/anchors.
* If you pasted straight quotes, please smarten them during editing.

== Error Presentation
Do not change the file being worked on.
Only present errors in the chat window.
List them in order of appearance in the file. 
Format each error as follows.

.format of error presentation
* line number of error, with type of error
** LINE 42: typo or plural mismatch etc
* the error preceded by the word ERROR
** ERROR: limply perceives todanked.
* the correction with no quotes
** REPAIR: Limply Percival toed the tanker.
* do not use quotes around the ERROR or REPAIR 
* please put a space between  each error

== Asciidoc 
All the files are .adoc files 
Please do not change spellings inside includes, images or other antoradoc calls without checking first
The files are structure for antoradocs web builds so some includes are formulated differently.
If an include is encountered it is okay to recursively check the spelling in that adoc

.adoc ignore list
* include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[] immediately follows an attribute block without a separating blank line
* :license: CC BY-SA 4.0 okay with wrong spelling would have to change it 400 times.

== Do not change files
Please do not change files unless explicitly asked to.

== Output an error file 

print out the list of errors created into a file called error_erase.txt 
If there is an existing error_erase.txt over write it with the new version

== Future Problems
I need to sort out typographical vs straight apostrophe
