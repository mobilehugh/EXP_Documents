The roadmap is a combination of actual, aspirational and fantastical goals for EXP.
The roadmap contains goals for the rules, tools and extended world of EXP.
Do not mistake desire and creativity for actual commitment or capacity to achieve these goals.
Perspiration has transformed some of these aspirations into rules.

.*Roadmap Components*
. <<_proposals,Proposals>>
. <<_soft_proposals,Soft Proposals>>
. <<_archive,Archive>>
. <<_versions,Versions>>

== Proposals

=== Drama Roll
Change sphincter dice to drama dice.
Let's shed decades of a$$hole tradition. ;)

=== d20 Task Roll 
Some find the Task Rolls in the Roll Playing system too much effort. 
It really does require maths and may slow down game play. 
The d20 Task Roll would align better with Saves and Competitions which are already d20 based.

The problem with a d20 task roll is that at higher level tasks the roll becomes irrelevant
Legacy system used three distinct die roll types.

.*Legacy d100 task rolls*
* d20 for attributes rolls
* d100 for task rolls
* d1000 for attack rolls

.*Steps for d20 Task Roll*
. <<_determine_difficulty,Determine Difficulty>>
. <<_determine_the_task_roll,Determine the Task Roll>>

==== Determine Difficulty
Knowing the difficulty of a task is only described generally. 
The persona would not know the actual number.

.*d20 Difficulty List*
* Facile - 2
* Trivial - 4
* Easy - 8
* Usual - 16
* Unusual - 24
* Hard - 32
* Really Hard - 38
* Tough - 64
* Impossible - 128
* Plot - 666 

==== Determine the Task Roll
The player rolls a d20 plus whatever bonuses apply.

.*Roll 1d20 plus...*
* Appropriate attribute
* Interests
* Skills
* Level
* Mutations?
* Fun description (1d4)

Players add all their rolls as part of a research team. 

=== Improvisation
Personal thoughts of how improv and role playing intersect.

.*Story Telling Methods*
* campaign is a Story Arch in a Milieu
** Story Arch is built from sub-stories
*** sub stories built from combat stories, and procedure stories
**** combat stories are told by dice and players
**** procedure stories are told by dice and players
** Story Arch is tied together by threads
*** threads are persona stories
**** player personas and referee personas

.*Story Telling is improv*
* a technical manual for creating sciency fiction stories through improv rpg
* sub-stories are the building block
** sub stories use STEPS and dice
* listening to players is LACE
* persona stories are Three Parts and STEPS

== Soft Proposals
* avoid double diminishing goals, as in EXPS
* emphasize safe and supportive play
* defence rating as a target or an adjustment
* the desired story of the ref and players wins
* less random 
* EXPS for role-playing
* theatrical combat rules
* charisma and privilege tends to win
* not everyone is articulate enough
* philosophy of dice 
* role of the random in the roll
* a common language for a shared improvised experience
* all your rolls are belong to us
* outcomes decided by dice and tables.
* outcomes not decided by referee thinkspace
* justification and post factualization
* From the outset both methods of play are equally valid.
* details details details
* the dice giveth and the dice taketh away
* 2m cubed is 70 cubic feet
* make the game more generous
* make the game more random

=== Generic Mythos
Missing parts from the generic mythos. 

.*Generic Mythos*
* time and chronovores hideaways, teleport, time stop and holdaways.
* sciency fiction vs science fiction vs science fantasy
* Consciousness
** Organics transfer sentience via reproduction and evolution
** Robots get sentience by accident unique and isolated
** Autonomous Intelligence (AI) are fabricated with consciousness
** Artificial Intelligence is not conscious, but may appear so

.*Prerequisites*
. Live action preferred
. Only seminal movie of franchise
. No animation (cell or computer) -- flexible
. No supers -- absolute
. Described in terms of EXP vocations and snark.
.. Mechanic meets knite. Critical roll kills 1.25 million. (Star Wars, 1977)
.. Nomad has telepathic pet and questionable culinary proclivities. (A Boy and His Dog, 1975)
.. Mercenaries fight aliens and an android. (Aliens, 1985)
.. Mercenaries lose their powered armour but still fight aliens. (Starship Troopers, 1997)

NOTE: Everything is different with the advent of LLM, text to image and soon text to moving image. 

== Archive
Stuff that had no place in the present document. 

=== Pithy Aphorisms
A Posse of Pithy Aphorisms
A suite of sweet sayings.

* all are players, including the referee
* one roll to rule them all and in the story bind them (4D2)
** one die one roll one sub story
* post factualization
* technomagical
* macro, micro, nano, molecular, ethereal bonds
* Story before dice, and story before rules
* Choose story and fun over rules and rolls.
* Find the least number of rules necessary and use one less
* the EXPedition EXPlores for EXPeriences.
* EXP is the game of technological chaos, and the dice deliver the chaos.
* let the table decide
* it's always a play test

=== Pithy Paragraphs
A posse of pithy paragraphs

.*APOPHENIA*
====
 “the tendency to perceive a connection or meaningful pattern
 between unrelated or random things (such as objects or ideas)”  
 Greek apo- (away, off, apart) + phainein (to show).
====

.*RULES*
====
are common language for a shared imagination experience.
====

.*ARMOUR*
====
Personal body armour is a perverse form of self-defense.
It is designed to protect someone who cannot, or will not, avoid combat situations.
It is as much an instrument of violence as any weapon.
The best way to avoid taking damage from combat is to avoid combat, 
====

.*CHAOS*
====
The EXP system is based on complete technological chaos.
Eons and eons of diverging levels of technology are layered on top of, and beside, each other.
Any of which may or may not be alien.
====

.*GET REST*
====
Go to sleep meat bag. This is frustrating. Robots do not express frustration.
====

.*POST FACTUALIZATION*
====
EXP takes liberties to mix elements of faux science and technomagical thinking to have fun.
The possibilities of technology is the basis of the sciency fiction milieu of EXP.
Referees and players must lever the magical power of the opaque black box.
An aptitude for rational fabrication and post factualization are essential tools.
====

.*REFEREE as STORY GUIDER*
====
A referee is free to tailor the hardware section to what best reflects her story.
She can easily do this by creating a few devices in advance and ignoring all the randomization harboured here.
Or you could play https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)[Traveller] instead.
====

.*ARTIFACTS*
====
They may find devices in an ancient destroyed laboratory.
They may earn devices from combat or cunning stunts. 
They may be paid in artifacts for a job well done.
====

.*ARTIFACTS*
====
Personas can start with artifacts, find artifacts, or get paid with artifacts.
Austere milieus may start personas with nothing but dust and dreams.
Creator species may allow the personas to browse the toy categories like an online store.
====

=== Oddities

The electronic pre-rolls were lost in a WP failure between V5 and V6.
There is a reference document in PDF form at xref:ROOT:attachment$exp_game_v401.pdf[EXP 4.01 1993 (32M)].
Remember this is V4 from 1993.

All original artwork from 1991 was located on 2024_0609_1442. 
New pieces found. 

=== Scenarios
There is a cheezy pre-rolled scenario in the reference document @ page 755 aka PDF page 769.
Remember this is V4 from 1993. 

.Impending Scenarios (2026 or later)
* Tsolodvor 
* GHOTI
* Kinder Kilner Haus for Wayward Mutants
* Adventures of Turnip
* Algo 

=== MSTR to MND 
Proposed Changes to Attributes.
Physical Strength (STR)-> Strength (STR).
Mental Strength (MND) -> Mind (MND).

.*MND Options*
* Acuity
* Aura
* Cognition
* Flux
* Fortitude
* Grit
* Mastery
* Metaphysics
* Mindcraft
* Potentiality
* Psyche
* Psychokinesis
* Psychomotor
* psychonic
* Radiance
* Resilience
* Resonance
* Serendipity
* Telekinesis
* Thoughtforce
* Volition
* Willforce
