== Introduction
EXP is a table top sciency fiction role playing game.
Printables is the section where you can get the files for printing the necessary stuff to play.
If you are feeling old school you can snag a copy of EXP v4. 
If you only have 6 sided dice to use you can snag a 4D2 Mechanic One Pager. 

All version 7 PDFs will have their accompanying docs as code ADOC companion downloadable as well.
An ADOC file is a markdown file that can be converted into a PDF using Asciidoc-pdf tools. 
Not only does this stay in EXP's docs as code goals, but allows players to style their PDFs as they see fit. 
All the tools are free and open source.


== Record Sheets
A collection of PDFs that are used to keep track of personas, and stuff, with pencil and paper.
Download, print and play.
We don't need to kill a tree.
Try the open source PDF tool https://xournalpp.github.io/[Xournal, window="_blank"].

== Build Your Own 
Below are the files necessary to generate (most) of the PDFs above.
If you can install asciidoc-pdf you can download and create persona record sheets for EXP.
The ADOC files correspond with the PDF of the same name.
The pdf_theme.yml will be needed for styling, and SVGs decompressed from the zip.
