EXP is a tabletop Sciency Fiction role-playing game.
Printables is the section where you can get the files for printing the necessary stuff to play.
If you are feeling old school you can snag a copy of EXP v4. 
If you only have 6 sided dice to use you can snag a 4D2 Mechanic one-pager. 

All version 7 PDFs include an accompanying docs‑as‑code ADOC companion download as well.
An ADOC file is a markdown file that can be converted into a PDF using asciidoctor-pdf tools. 
This supports EXP’s docs‑as‑code goals and lets players style their PDFs as they see fit. 
All the tools are free and open source.


== Record Sheets
A collection of PDFs that are used to keep track of personas, and stuff, with pencil and paper.
Download, print and play.
We don't need to kill a tree.
Try the open source PDF tool https://xournalpp.github.io/[Xournal, window="_blank"].

=== Build Your Own 
PDFs are the only way to properly print out persona records for face to face table play. 
Ultimately it would be nice that these PDFs could be fillable by the players directly.
This exceeds the skill set and patience of the author at this time. 
Keeping in mind that avoiding proprietary software is an important part of this enterprise. 

This is made available for those who wish to alter their persona records.
The author does not pretend to have any graphic design skills. 

File the file at https://rules.expgame.com/appendices/printables.html[Printables at EXP Game, window="_blank"]

Nomenclature of the files is described here.
yyyy refers to the year, like 2025.
mmdd refers to the 2 digit month (mm) and the 2 digit day (dd).
So the adoc_to_pdf zip released on April 20th 2024 would be adoc_to_pdf_2025_0420.zip.
This dating format is also applied to adoc files and pdf files. 

.*Contents of adoc_to_pdf_yyyy_mmdd.zip*
. /styling folder
.. contains yml themes
.. contains the svg files
. /PDF folder
.. pdf files of the latest printouts (for convenience)
. adoc files that can be converted to PDFs
.. this is folder in which to run asciidoctor-pdf

.*Let's just print some PDFs*
. download and unzip folder adoc_to_pdf_yyyy_mmdd.zip
. navigate to the created folder (adoc_to_pdf_yyyy_mmdd)
. navigate to the PDF folder
. print 'em out
.. these may differ from built PDFs
.. double sided long edge works best

.*Steps for building PDFs*
. install asciidoc-pdf (a gem file)
.. https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/install/[asciidoctor install instructions, window="_blank"]
. download and unzip folder adoc_to_pdf_yyyy_mmdd.zip
. navigate to the created folder (adoc_to_pdf_yyyy_mmdd)
. run asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-theme=styling/desired_theme.yml desired_file.adoc
.. anthro: asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-theme=styling/theme_portrait.yml anthro_portrait_yyyy_mmdd.adoc
.. alien: asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-theme=styling/theme_portrait.yml alien_portrait_yyyy_mmdd.adoc
... uses same theme as anthro
.. robot: asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-theme=styling/them_portrait_robot.yml robot_portrait_yyyy_mmdd.adoc
.. alien: asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-theme=styling/theme_alien_landscape.yml alien_landscape_yyyy_mmdd.adoc
... alien landscape is used for alien arena to save space on the table
. above patterns should be enough to sort out most others. 

For those with individual needs and better layout skills.

.*Steps for editing ADOCs*
. download and unzip folder adoc_to_pdf_yyyy_mmdd.zip
. navigate to the created folder (adoc_to_pdf_yyyy_mmdd)
. open adoc files in a TEXT editor, because every character counts 
. https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[how to asciidoc, window="_blank"]
. go to above for printing out your beautiful new PDFs.


If you don't want to print stuff out and don't want to use a virtual table top. https://xournalpp.github.io/[xournal] is an open source markup tool. 


TIP:: The Build your own zip file has a copy of every recent PDF.


== Historical
Things from the past that may be useful. 
For example, using persona record sheets from v5 (2010) that are missing in v7.
