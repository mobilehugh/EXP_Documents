Versions in chronological order.

Thanks to everyone.

== Version 0
Can't throw enough respect to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis_Alpha[Metamorphosis Alpha]. 
EXP is a homebrew based on this RPG.
Eventually I would like to populate this with which seeds lead to EXP. 


== Version 1
*Homebrew 1980 by Hugh MacLeod*

Notes::
Typed on an olivetti underwood electric typewriter. 
Photocopied sections contained in D-Ring binders.

Special Thanks:: 
The minds that changed the meaning of what a game meant, and how collective play could work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ward_(game_designer)[James Ward] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_World[Gamma World], and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis_Alpha[Metamorphosis Alpha]); Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson (Dungeons and Dragons). 

While https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Opera_(role-playing_game)[Space Opera] came along much later it demonstrated that an organized game with epic, comedic space shenanigans was possible.
