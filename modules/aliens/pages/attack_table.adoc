= Alien Attack Table

The combat rules in the Roll Playing System employs an attack matrix called the attack table.
The player refers to the attack table every time she makes an attack roll.
An alien's attack table is for their evolved natural attacks. 
The Strike Attack would be for her nasty bite attack, and the Fling Attack would be for her steaming sap blob spittles. The alien attack table is not for artifact weapons.

== Aliens and Weapons
The attack table generated here is for the alien's naturally evovled attacks and *not* artifact weapons.
For an alien to even consider using a weapon the species must be a tool user.
Even a simple tool user can use an artifact weapon (gun, grenade, axe, etc).
However flora or fauna aliens do not even comprehend tools of any kind.
A non-tool using alien would step over the fusion rifle and attack the robot with her beak. 

If an alien does not have a Vocation she must use the Raw Bonus of zero.
If the alien species has education and she can follow a Vocation then a Vocation Attack Table is generated for artifact weapons attacks. 

.*Aliens and Artifact Weapons*
* Flora or Fauna - No weapon use or interest at all
* Tool Using - May use a weapon with Raw Bonus of zero
* Educated - May use Vocation Attack Table and it's Skilled Bonus

The player can use a Vocation Attack Table for  artifact weapons.
The Alien Attack Table is used for evolved natural attacks. 
Managing the burden of having two attack tables is up to the referee and the table of players.
Aliens can be powerful and being able to use their super charged attributes to shoot things may affect game balance.
