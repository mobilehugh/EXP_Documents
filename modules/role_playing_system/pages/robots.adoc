= Robot Fabrication

Robots are the colloquial name for the family Machinidae. 
Machinidae represents any life form that is inorganic and fabricated.
An organic fabricated life form would be an alien.
An inorganic non-fabricated life form would be a robot.
Anthros, aliens and robots fabricate robots.

== Attributes
The standard attributes of EXP are present in all personas.
In the Role Playing System, players only record those attributes at which the persona excels.
A persona can have a blank attributes section and function fine.
Another persona may have the attribute Intelligence. 

====
*Attributes:* INT
====

The persona's Intelligence attribute is worth noting. 
A persona can excel at more than one attribute.

====
*Attributes:* INT, DEX
====

There is no score assigned to an attribute. 
The persona either excels at an attribute or not.
The attributes help the personas when they undertake maneuvers.
For example, a persona with STR would be better at lifting than a persona with INT.
When two personas have the same attribute, then no advantage is given.
If two personas grappling both had Strength, then neither gains an advantage.
However, if a persona with STR and DEX is grappling with a persona with just STR, they get a DEX advantage.

These advantages are called shifts and increase the chance of success with the 4D2 Mechanism.

Most Excellent Attribute::
The player rolls once to determine the most excellent attribute of her alien persona.

include::role_playing_system:partial$best_attribute_table.adoc[]

Awareness::
Awareness indicates how aware a persona is of her surroundings. 
It indicates how well is the persona's brain connects to the outside world. 
The attribute is a collective measure of the persona's sensors. 
AWE includes senses like hearing, vision, smell, touch and taste. 
Awareness does not include the sixth sense or a sense of style. 
The abbreviation for Awareness is AWE.

Charisma::
Charisma is charm, looks and sociability all combined into one value. 
A high Charisma represents a high proficiency at getting along with other personas. 
This attribute is universal, so any persona with a high CHA would be socially adept. 
A persona's Charisma is crucial for inter-persona interactions.
The abbreviation for Charisma is CHA.

Constitution::
Constitution represents a persona's internal physique.
CON is a combination of wellness, immunity, energy extraction, healing ability.
A high CON is better to repel disease, resist poisons, and repair damaged tissue.
The abbreviation for Constitution is CON.

Dexterity::
Dexterity represents the connection between the brain and the outside world.
Agility, balance, eye-hand, reflexes and running speed are components of Dexterity.
A high DEX person could run faster, dance better and quicker reflexes.
Dexterity would help the persona catch a priceless vase or dive through a closing door.
The abbreviation for Dexterity is DEX.

Intelligence::
Intelligence indicates the smarts of the persona.
Elements of INT are memory, deduction, creativity, adaptability and their synergism. 
The higher the Intelligence of the persona, the smarter she is.
The abbreviation for Intelligence is INT.

Mind::
Robots do not have this attribute.
Mind is an organic connection to Kirlian Space that represents free will and wisdom.

Strength::
Strength represents force the persona can generate to get work done. 
STR is a combination of leverage, power and physique. 
Strength determines how much the persona can lift or damage by brute force. 
STR helps kicking open doors, breaking bonds, or crushing beer bottles.
The abbreviation for Strength is STR.

Hit Points::
There are no hit points in the Role Playing System.
Combat and damage are both absolute and descriptive. 
There is no quantitative measure of well-being like 32 hit points out of 42.
Personas are damaged in combat by losing attributes, skills and abilities instead of hit points.
When the 4D2 Mechanic generates a Cataclysmic Failure, the persona can lose an attribute, skill or ability.
Extreme failures on the 4D2 Mechanic can mortally wound or kill the persona.
The abbreviation for hit points is HPS.

Control Factor::
Control factor represents how indebted the robot is to it's previous job or task.
In the role playing system Control Factor can be chosen by a player to make her robot more free willed.

Adaptability::
This indicates how well the robot can be adjusted, repaired, upgraded or side graded. 

Size::
Size is considered an attribute and is included with the attributes section of the persona record. 

Social Standing::
There is no Social Standing in the Role Playing System.
The players must role play social interactions in the Role Playing System (go figure).
The abbreviation for Social Standing is SOC.

EXPS and Level::
There are no Experience Points or Experience levels in the Role Playing System. 
Personas earn additional attributes, skills and abilities instead of experience points or levels.
The 4D2 Mechanic can generate new attributes, skills or abilities.
This process replaces experience points and experience levels.
The abbreviation for experience points is EXPS.

== Series
The robot type determines its intended reason to be.
A robot type describes the primary function of the persona.
A heavy combot is a very different persona from a domestic janitorial robot.

In the Role Playing System, players use the Single Role Robot Type Table to determine their robot type.
The referee should massage the robot type to suit her campaign's milieu.
For example, is a first-level expedition ready for a heavy combot? 
Players can choose their robot type if that choice improves the story.

== Peripherals
Robot abilities are hardware-based and can also be called peripherals. 
Robot skills are software-based and can be called programming.
Everything a robot can do is lumped into peripherals. 
Some series and models get specific peripherals automatically.
The relevant peripheral tables are included here for convenience.

To generate a toy for the persona jump to xref:hardware:a_introduction.adoc#_toy_type[Hardware,window=_blank].

== Name
The player should name her robot persona at the end of its fabrication.
The robot name should include a persona name, a model number and a fabricator. 
For more detail than you ever wanted jump to xref:robots:name.adoc[robot name,window=_blank].

== Appearance
The player should decant her robot's description down to its most prominent features.
For example, the player picks the essential defining parts of her robot: a matte black sphere sitting on wide treads.

== History
Keep track of the fun.
Entirely optional.
