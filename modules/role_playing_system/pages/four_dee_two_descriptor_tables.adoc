= 4D2 Descriptor Tables

Often the Outcome gives enough info for the players to tell the story.
The description of the outcome is easy for Immaculate Success and Cataclysmic Failure.
For the other 19 Outcomes, the players may need some help.

For recurring 4D2 Mechanic decisions, there are Descriptor Tables.
Descriptor Tables give examples of what could happen according to the Outcome.
Concrete descriptors are critical when a persona's life is on the line. 

NOTE: *The Descriptor can come from the players or a table.*
