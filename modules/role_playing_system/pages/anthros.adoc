= Anthro Creation
All anthros are upright, bipedal.
They have hands, heads and faces.
The fake taxonomy of life in EXP assigns Anthros to the family Hominidae and the genus Homo.
Mundane terra has an infestation of Hominidae homo pure strain.
EXP has many other anthro types.
Each anthro type is considered a species with names like homo avis or homo felis.
A homo felis (feline) can also add descriptors such as a cat, lion or cougar.
The player chooses the final appearance of the anthro type.

== Attributes
The standard attributes of EXP are present in all personas.
In the Role-Playing System, players only record those attributes at which the persona excels.
A persona can have a blank attributes section and function fine.
Another persona may have the attribute Intelligence. 

====
*Attributes:* INT
====

The persona's Intelligence attribute is worth noting. 
A persona can excel at more than one attribute.

====
*Attributes:* INT, DEX
====

There is no score assigned to an attribute. 
The persona either excels at an attribute or not.
The attributes help the personas when they undertake maneuvers.
For example, a persona with STR would be better at lifting than a persona with INT.
When two personas have the same attribute, then no advantage is given.
If two personas grappling both had Strength, then neither gains an advantage.
However, if a persona with STR and DEX is grappling with a persona with just STR, they get a DEX advantage.

These advantages are called shifts and increase the chance of success with the 4D2 Mechanism.

Size::
Size is an attribute assigned to every persona.
All anthros are size medium.
The player records the medium size in the attributes section of the persona record.
For example, the persona record sheet could have Medium and INT recorded under 

Most Excellent Attribute::
The player rolls once to determine the most excellent attribute of her anthro persona.
