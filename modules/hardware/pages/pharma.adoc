The pharma described in this chapter are fantastic miracle substances capable of diagnosing, preparing, and administering the proper remedy.
They can do wonders, but they can also have deadly toxic effects.
Pharmaceuticals come in groups of doses called a prescription.
A prescription may consist of pills, injections or liquids.
A prescription will typically have a negligible wate.

== Pharma Data

=== Labelling
Prescriptions on mundane terra are usually well labelled.
In EXP, the apothecary that filled this prescription may have been deceased for a thousand years, or the language used no longer exists.
In short, prescription markings are essentially random. 
A vet is the best bet for identifying, and administering, artifact pharma.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_labelling.adoc[]

=== Administration
The administration method indicates how the pharma dose gets into the persona's physiology.
Since the admin method determines the shape of the pharma it also doubles as appearance.
So administration is where the entirely unhelpful colour of the pharma is determined as well.
The colour indicates the pill, container or liquid colour.
Jump to xref:hardware:appearance.adoc#_colour_your_whirled[Colour] to spice things up.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_admin_types.adoc[]

=== Metabolism
There are many different persona types in EXP.
Metabolism is an __optional rule__ that can throw some pharmacologic curve balls into the story.
The metabolism interactions between family types (anthro, alien, robot) can lead to severe toxicity reactions.
There are no particular intra genus interactions. 
A feline can use canine pharma with at most cosmetic consequences.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_family_metabolism.adoc[]

==== Anthro
This pharma is for for anthros.
Often the players will stop there and not worry about specific genus.
If the anthro type does not match the metabolism type of the pharma, the safety level decreases by half.
If an alien is using an anthro pharma, there is an automatic toxicity effect.
Anthro metabolism pharma does not affect robots.

==== Alien 
This pharma is for a specific alien species.
Alien pharma is designed for a specific alien species and does not work between aliens.
The method of delivery will match the size of the alien.
Gigantic aliens would have larger pills and syringes.
If an anthro or a non-species alien uses this pharma, they automatically have an toxicity effect.
Alien metabolism pharma does not affect robots.

==== Robot 
This pharma is a nanosynthetic meant only for robots.
Robot pharma are like spectacular motor oils or bizarre fuels.
Liquid programming is another label for robotic materials that cause pharma effects.
For example, a robotic injection would appear more like a pneumatic dagger than a hypodermic needle.
Anthros or aliens that manage to dose themselves with robot pharma have n automatic toxicity effect.

=== Doses
Doses of pharma is the equivalent of the amount of pharma found. 
For complicated pharma only one dose is available. 
One can consider all pharma complicated except for Trauma heals. 
Trauma heals are complicated but startifact Trauma heals come in script of 1-8 (1d8) 

=== Toxicity
Pharma in EXP are complicated technological compounds that both diagnose and remodel the persona's body.
This level of invasiveness makes Toxicity very common.
A toxicity is an unexpected change in the body's chemistry that arises from taking pharma.
A side effect may be harmful or good, while toxicity effects are all bad.

Essentially the player makes a saving throw against the toxicity of the pharma every time it is used. 
Toxic effects are usually random, but the referee can assign specific toxicities to a pharma

The higher the tech level the safer the pharma.
If pharma safety and tech level is a thing the player may add half the pharma's tech level to her saving roll.

WARNING: *Side effect and adverse effects are unused euphemisms because artifacts don't have marketing campaigns.*

==== Toxicity Effect
Failing the saving roll will result in a toxic effect.
Toxic effects can be irritating or life threatening. 

include::hardware:partial$pharma_toxicity_effects.adoc[]

==== Toxicity Duration

include::hardware:partial$pharma_durations.adoc[]


=== Parameters
Explanations of the pharma parameters.

==== Duration 
This note describes the length of time that the effect of the pharma will last.
The onset is instantaneous, and the body will return to normal at the end of the duration.
Remember that toxic effects may have a longer duration than the pharma's effect.
A Permanent duration indicates a permanent change in the patient's body.
The player must roll those drugs with a range of times listed for a duration each time a dose is applied.

==== Safety 
Safety is simply the chance that the substance has no toxic effects.
The player makes a safety check for each dose taken.
Safety is usually equal to the tech level of the pharma.
A tech level 10 pharma has a 10% chance of no toxic effects.
If tech level is not part of your ruleset, the default is TL10.

==== EXPS 
EXPS are the experience points granted for identifying the prescription.
The player can determine the pharma's effect by winning a vet task roll.
Imbibing the pharma and correctly deducing the effect can also earn the EXPS.

==== Value 
The value is an indicator of the pharma's worth in eps.
The value is for a single dose.
If a prescription has three doses, then the prescription is worth three times the given value.
The value of pharma can change according to the market's needs.

== Pharma Catalogue

=== Altergenic

[horizontal]
Duration:: Permanent
Toxicity:: 42
EXPS:: 1000
Value:: 6000000

This pharma permanently alters the genetics of the persona giving them a mutation.
The mutation can be psionic or phenomic, but will __not__ be a defect.
The player will not know which mutation the persona has taken on.
Part of the fun, danger and story, involves figuring out the mutation.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_mutation_type.adoc[]

Colour::
Colour deviations are a permanent side effect specific to this pharma.
The colour mutation will change the persona's skin or coat colour.
They appear after the mutant's first sleep after dosing.
Make a jump over to xref:hardware:appearance.adoc#_colour_your_whirled[Colour,window=_blank].

Psionic::
The persona has acquired a psionic mutation.
The psionic mutation takes hold immediately, but the power is not immediately understood.
Psionic mutations are hard to figure out and may only reveal themselves under duress.
Jump to xref:wetware:psionics.adoc#_mutation_type[Psionic Mutations,window=_blank] to generate a fresh new mutation. 

Phenomic::
The persona has acquired a phenomic mutation.
The phenomic mutation will take a few nights of sleep to grow in.
The mutation's growth can be itchy, painful or unseemly.
Jump to xref:wetware:phenomics.adoc[Phenomic Mutations,window=_blank] to generate the mutation.

=== Cure

[horizontal]
Duration:: Until next time.
Toxicity:: 12 per use
EXPS:: 100
Value:: Special

A cure arrests the progress of a pathogen like a disease or poison.
A cure is not an inoculation and does not prevent future infection or affliction.
A cure is not a heal and does not repair the damage from an illness or affliction.
Cures stop the affliction in its tracks and remove it from the persona.

Most cures have a small benefit if the persona has nothing to cure. 
For example, Ageing Cure will increase the persona's life span by 10%.
Repeated use of an aging cure to prolong life span will increase the chance of toxicity. 
So by the third time the persona uses an aging cure the toxicity will be 36. 

include::hardware:partial$pharma_cure_types.adoc[]

Ageing::
The ageing cure removes any __abnormal__ ageing the patient has suffered.
If there is no abnormal ageing (like from a Chronologic attack), the cure increases the patient's life span by 10%.
Value is 250000 per dose.

Attribute::
The attribute cure can restore attributes reduced by natural ageing or unnatural attacks. 
For example if a persona had her strength reduced by an injury the attribute cure would repair this. 
This cure only has toxic effects if there are no degraded attributes.
The attribute cure will repair the most recently damaged attribute.
Value is 500000 per dose.

Decomposition::
This cure prevents the decomposition of a dead or soon-to-die persona.
The persona will not decompose, but they remain dead. 
The dead, but not rotting, persona requires advanced veterinarian machinery for rejuvenation. 
This cure has been previously called  "cured ham" or "poison apple."
Value is 250000 per dose.

Infection::
Infection cure supercharges the patient's immune system removing any infectious invaders.
The types of infections include bacterial, viral, parasitic, prion or other sciency fiction infestation.
Further doses of an infection cure have no further benefit to the patient.
An infection cure does not harm symbiotic infections like gut flora. 
Value is 50000 per dose.

Mutation::
This cure removes the patient's most recent mutation. 
The cure does not discriminate and removes beneficial and defective mutations.
A veterinarian 20DD maneuver is needed for the mutation cure to remove a particular mutation.
Value is 1000000 per dose.

Psionics::
The psionics cure briefly disconnects the persona's consciousness from the think space.
This reset interrupts all psionic effects on the persona.
For example, a persona suffering mind control would be thinking for themselves after taking this cure.
The duration of the psionic cure depends on what makes for a better story. 
Value is 1000000 per dose.

Radiation::
A rad cure removes any ongoing effects of radiation from the persona.
If taken early enough, the cure can avoid damage from radiation as well.
How early is early enough? 
The persona would have to know that radiation damage is imminent. 
A veterinarian can use this cure to prevent radiation damage with a successful 15DD maneuver per dose.
Value is 50000 per dose.

Thermal::
A thermal cure returns organic flesh to its original state after cold or heat damage.
The thermal cure does not heal hit points back but restores any permanent damage due to thermal injury.
The cure will also arrest any ongoing thermal damage from an active attack.  
Value is 50000 per dose.

Toxins::
Toxin cure arrests the effects of any non-radiation toxin.
Toxins include envenomation, poison gas, chemical exposures etc.
The toxin cure does not prevent radiation toxicity or toxic personalities.
The cure does not reverse damage or repair a persona's hit points. 
A veterinarian can use this cure to prevent injury from a specific expected poisoning with a 15DD maneuver.
Value is 50000 per dose.

Trauma::
A trauma cure removes any __abnormal__ reduction to the persona's hit point maximum (HPM).
If there is no injury to the persona's hit points max, the patient's hit point max increases by 10%
The trauma cure has no impact on the patient's hit point max (HPM).
Value is 250000 per dose.

Ubiquitous::
The ubiquitous cure is programable by a veterinarian to cure what ails the persona. 
The vet and persona can choose whatever they would like cured with this generic cure.
The vet must win a 10 DD maneuver roll.
More difficult cures like curing a defective mutation or a mental illness would increase the DD.
If a pharmacologic impasse arises the players should consult the xref:uncombat:sphincter_rolls.adoc[Sphincter Roll,window=_blank].
Value is 4200042 per dose.


=== Enhancement

[horizontal]
Duration:: Permanent
Toxicity:: 24
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 10000000

This complicated pharma permanently enhances a specific persona attribute.
The new attribute scores do not instantly appear.
The persona must earn the improved attribute over time.
The attribute increase can arise through training, more pharma, or extraordinary events. 
For example, a strength enhancement may require a strength training regimen or may suddenly appear in a life or death strength test.
Repeated dosing with enhancements can lead to permanent attribute damage. 

include::hardware:partial$pharma_enhancement_types.adoc[]

=== Heal 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Until the next injury
Toxicity:: 12 (and varies)
EXPS:: 100
Value:: Special

Heals are pharma that immediately repair damaged tissue.
The vast majority of heals repair physical damage and improve the persona's hit point (HPS).
The less common heal type restores damaged attributes.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_heal_type.adoc[]

==== Attribute
Attribute heals restore damaged attribute scores.
A persona who lost Charisma points to a burn, or a persona that lost Dexterity points to ageing will benefit from this pharma.
To determine the attribute and it's heal amount jump to <<_enhancement,Enhancement>>
Attributes cannot exceed their original values by using heals.

==== Resus
A resus heal will bring the persona from negative HPS to 0 HPS and arrests the dying process. 
This will leave the persona in an unconscious not dying state.
No further heal pharma can be used on the persona after a resus heal (no trauma or restore heals).
After using a resus heal the persona must be tended to by a veterinarian.

==== Restore
A restore heal will bring the persona back to full hit points provided that they have at least 1 hit point. 
A restore heal cannot be used on a persona that has 0 or less hit points.
If a veterinarian or a trauma heal brings the persona to 1 or more hit points a restore heal can be used.
A restore heal cannot be used on a persona that just imbibed a resus heal. 
Repeated use of restore heals increases the toxicity by 12 each time.
When administered by a veterinarian the toxicity of repeat doses can be decreased.

==== Trauma
Trauma heals restore a preset number of hit points to the persona imbibing the heal.
A trauma heal will restore 5 to 40 HPS of damage immediately. 
The player rolls 1d8 and multiplies the result by 5. 
The value of the 1d8 also determines the toxicity of the trauma heal.
A trauma heal does not work on a persona with 0 or less hit points. 
A trauma heal cannot be used on a persona that just imbibed a resus heal. 
When administered by a veterinarian the toxicity of the trauma heal can be avoided.


=== Intumescent

[horizontal]
Duration:: 1-6 (1d6) minutes
Toxicity:: 6
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 2000000

Intumescent pharma rapidly swell an attribute beyond normal bounds.
This boost is unnatural and temporary.
A transient intumescence adds 50% the attribute that it affects.
An awareness of 15 would become an Awareness of 23. 
Anthro attribute restrictions do not impede the the intumescent effect.
A radical physical transformation accompanies intumescence.
A strength intumescent transforms the persona into a muscle-layered hulk.
An awareness intumescence dilates the eyes, ears and nose of the persona. 

Extreme attribute scores allow for abnormal performance.
Super awareness may let the persona smell chemical formulas or see microscopic cracks. 
Super mind may let the persona see Kirlian auras.
Spectacular charisma may let the persona woo a large crowd with a magnificent oration.

The effects of this pharma are desirable to players, but abuse will lead to worsening toxicity.
Simultaneous intumescent use multiplies their toxicities.
So using a strength and intelligence intumescent has a toxicity of 36.
Using them too close together has additive toxicity. 
So using two strengths in a row has a toxicity of 12.

=== Inoculation 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Permanent
Toxicity:: 18
EXPS:: 1001
Value:: 1000000

Inoculations are not cures. 
Inoculations are not heals.
They neither repair nor fix the persona.
Inoculations increase the persona's resistance to future effects.
If a persona inoculated against paralysis, she will double her CON when trying to win a saving throw versus paralysis or stun attacks.
Stacking different inoculations has additive toxicity.

=== Narcotic 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Special
Toxicity:: 24
EXPS:: -42 (yes minus)
Value:: 42

Narcotics are recreational pharma.
The narcotic effect may be a side effect of a malfunctioning pharma or a bespoke recreational pharma.
In EXP, narcotics do not offer insightful experiences that enhance one's mind.
Narcotics render personas ineffective for their duration and have both temporary and permanent toxicity effects.
The duration of the narcotic effect is the used the pharm toxic effect duration table. 

Narcotics temporarily impair the persona's Awareness, Dexterity, Intelligence and Mind attributes.
For the duration of the impairment, the persona's AWE, DEX, and INT drop by 1-6 (1d6) points, and her Mind drops by half.
It is up to the referee to decide if the attribute drop can kill the persona.
Narcotic misadventures regularly kill pure strains on terra mundane.
Knites avoid any such excursions into the chaos of the mind.

Narcotics permanently decrease the persona's EXPS total by 42 points.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_durations.adoc[]

include::hardware:partial$pharma_narcotic_effect.adoc[]


=== Poison
This table is not used in EXP. 
It is kept here for posterity and may be of use somehow.
Lethal toxic effects are left over from the Poison Pharma removed in version 7.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_lethal_toxin_types.adoc[]

=== Regen 

[horizontal]
Duration:: Until next time.
Toxicity:: 20
EXPS:: 1000
Value:: 2000000

Regen is a pharma for repairing or replacing injured or missing organs and limbs. 
Each regen pharma has a specific focus, but the pharma will always attempt to fix something.
If there is damaged biologic system imbibing regen pharma is straightforward.
Regen will diagnose what is missing and get to work repairing or replacing.
If the persona has no malfunctioning or missing bits, the regen pharma will still try and fix something.
This will have a random (fun) effect on the persona
The process is usually noisy and gross and takes about 10-100 (10d10) hours.

The appearance and nature of the regen part will reflect the family metabolism of the pharma.
For example, if a feline were to use canine regen to replace a missing arm, she would have a canine arm.
This dog arm would be a fully functioning dog-like limb on an otherwise feline persona.
An alien metabolism type would create a limb that resembles an xref:aliens:alien_shape.adoc#_terrain_types[Alien Body Part,window=_blank].
A canine may have a limb that looks like a worm, but it would function perfectly well. 
Not surprisingly, a robotic metabolism type will replace the missing limb or part with a cybernetic appearing limb. 

==== Special Toxicity Effects
Regen pharma has the usual toxicity and associated toxicity effects. 
The special vestigial limb toxicity is rare and only occurs in personas that have nothing to fix, and suffer a standard toxic reaction.

Regen pharma has a very unique toxicity effect of possibly generating a random vestigial limb.
If a persona using regen has all her body parts intact, the pharma becomes confused.
Confused regen pharma will try and fix something that is not broken, growing a vestigial limb from a random location.
If the player fails a saving roll against the regen pharma toxicity using her CON she will get a vestigial limb.
If the player wins a saving roll against the regen pharma toxicity using her DEX she can control the vestigial limb. 
A persona can only have one controllable vestigial limb.

include::combat:partial$hit_location_snap.adoc[]

A vet can dial in the misuse of this pharma to get desired parts.
This would be a 42DD maneuver and a xref:uncombat:task_rolls.adoc#_research_teams[Research Teams] is recommended.

=== Transgenic 

[horizontal]
Duration:: 2-200 (2d100) hours
Toxicity:: 18
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 2000000

This pharma gives the persona a temporary psionic or phenomic mutation effect.
The persona transiently acquires a mutation.
Unlike the gradual onset of the altergenic pharma, the mutation effect comes quickly reveals its power.

include::hardware:partial$pharma_mutation_type.adoc[]

Colour::
Colour deviations are a *permanent* side effect of this pharma.
The colour change immediately appears with a mutation effect.
This colour change can be as simple or as fancy as the referee desires.
Make a jump over to xref:hardware:appearance.adoc#_colour_your_whirled[Colour,window=_blank].

Psionic::
The persona has acquired a psionic mutation effect.
The psionic mutation comes on with a ferocious headache and quickly reveals itself.
Jump to xref:wetware:psionics.adoc#_mutation_type[Psionic Mutations,window=_blank] to generate a fresh new mutation. 
*This mutation cannot be a defect.*
When the duration ends, the psionic mutation fades away.

Phenomic::
The persona has acquired a phenomic mutation effect.
The phenomic mutation violently explodes out of the persona's body.
The process is painful and unseemly.
Jump to xref:wetware:phenomics.adoc[Phenomic Mutations,window=_blank] to generate the mutation.
*This mutation cannot be a defect.*
When the duration ends, the phenomic mutation withers away and falls off.
