Artillery is both a stand alone section and a subsection of guns.
An artillery piece is nothing more than a big rifle with an area of effect.
Artillery takes guns and multiplies their range, damage and effects.

*Artillery is very deadly.* 
====
Misuse of artillery, which is usually guaranteed, can wipe out entire expeditions.
====

Artillery is used by military on a field of battle.
Artillery is not meant to be a personal weapon used in personal combat.
Most often the target of artillery cannot be seen by the gunner.
There is a gap between firing the firing of artillery that does not match typical combat turns.
Usually a persona needs artillery skill to fire, reload and fire again.

=== Reloading
Artillery is used by military on a field of battle.
Artillery is not meant to be a personal weapon used in personal combat.
Most often the target of artillery cannot be seen by the gunner.
There is a gap between firing artillery. 

Reloading of artillery takes 5 units (ten seconds).
By standards of mundane terran artillery this is a generous rate of fire.
Reloading time takes the same if ramming in a shell, loading fuel or replacing batteries.
If there are no moving parts or expendables the artillery needs a cool down of 6 units between shots.

.*Reload Times and Gun Type*
* Shoot reload is 6 units
* Sotto-2 reload is 3 units
* Sotto-3 reload is 2 units
* Flotto reload is 1 unit

=== Parameters

==== Base Weapon
Link to the weapon the artillery is based on.

==== Reload
Units between shots.
Typically 6 units. 
Faster weapons may have faster reloads.

==== Range 
Artillery has both a maximum range and a minimum range.
The first number is the maximum range, and the number in brackets is the minimum range.
For example, an artillery piece with a range of 800h (8h) could only target hexes between 9 and 800 hexes.
Minimum range is unique to artillery, and it simply cannot attack anything within that range.

==== Area of Effect 
Artillery launches area of effect attacks over great distances. 
Every target caught within the area of effect is damaged the same as a grenade or bomb attack.

The area of effect is a radius in hexes. 
Some artillery areas of effect have a range instead of a specific number.
The dice needed to generate the range follow in brackets.

==== Damage 
Damage lists the number of hit points the area of effect attack inflicts on its unlucky targets.
The damage parameter has a range, and the dice needed to generate that range following in brackets.

==== Magazine 
Artillery has a magazine.
The magazine size is equivalent to the highest rate of fire capable by the base gun type.
An artillery piece modelled after a Shoot weapon has a 1 round magazine.
An artillery piece modelled after a type F weapon has a 15 round magazine. 
The magazine parameter "battery" indicates that the artillery crew must replace all the batteries before firing.

==== Wate 
The wate of the artillery has two parts.
The first part is the wate of the cannon. 
The number in brackets is the wate of the ammunition.
The ammo wate could be the wate of a shell, fuel, or battery.

If the ammunition states "Battery," then the artillery uses battery energy.
Battery-powered artillery uses a lot of batteries.
Battery-powered artillery batteries use 20 times the number of batteries generated in materiel.

==== EXPS 
The persona wins this experience point award for identifying the big gun. 
The player may identify the gun by deduction or by firing. 

==== Value 
The value indicates the MSRP (Money Suggested in RolePlaying) of the gun in eps.
The value in brackets is the value of the ammunition in eps.

== Artillery Catalogue

=== Annihilator

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_antimat_rifle[Antimat Rifle,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 1500h (15h)
Area of Effect:: 75h
Damage:: 105-240 (1d50+90)
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 375kg (0.5kg + Battery)
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 37500000(1500000) + Battery

The annihilator fires a blob of antimatter suspended in a lattice of electrons.
This lattice shatters at range annihilator nearby matter and creating an explosion.
The artillery destroys the target hex, eliminating 600 kgs of matter.
The explosion releases a blast of heavy particles and superheated gases.
Everything within the 75 hex area of effect takes the listed damage.

A malfunction with this weapon indicates the electron lattice has shattered within the gun.
The artillery piece explodes and inflicts 25-70 (5d10+20) hit points of damage in a two hex radius.

=== Beehive Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_bee_gun[Bee Gun,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 1500h (15h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: Death
Magazine:: 1
Wate:: 150kg (4kg)
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 3750000 (1500000)

The beehive's activation chamber excites a hive of insects into a poisonous rage.
The weapon bathes the area of effect in an explosion of deadly venomous insects.
Every organic creature in the area of effect must win a poison roll or die.
The poison intensity is a ridiculous 57-72 (3d6+54).
Most referees will limit this to a poison intensity of 25.
If a persona survives, she will be comatose for 1-4 (1d4) days.

A malfunction with this weapon indicates that the hive has harmlessly disintegrated in transit.

=== Howitzer

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_bolt_action_rifle[Bolt Action Rifle,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 1200h (12h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 12-144 (12d12)
Magazine:: 1
Wate:: 278kg (4.5kg)
EXPS:: 400
Value:: 50000 (100)

The howitzer is a modern take on the classic long gun.
This cannon is fed with explosive shells and aimed with furious cranking.

A malfunction destroys the weapon and inflicts 12-144 (12d12) hit points of damage to the firing hex.

=== Glacier Gun 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_cryogun[Cryogun,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 100h (1h)
Area of Effect:: 6h wide 
Damage:: 12-72 (12d6)
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 150kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 600000 + Battery

The glacier gun freezes everything within its six hex by 100 hex area of effect.
Each point of damage equals a % chance of being entrapped in ice
So 25 HPS of damage indicates 25% of being trapped in the ice.
The chance to break free is a Tough Strength challenge.
Trapped targets will be cold and trapped until the glacier melts.
The glacier melts in 18 to 180 units (18d10).

A misfire with this weapon results in a loss of all battery power.

This weapon is also called a Cryo Cannon.

=== Disintegrator 

[horizontal,window=_blank]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_disintegration_gun[Disintegration Gun,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 1000h (10h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 24-192 (24d8)
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 338kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 50000000 + Battery 

The disintegrator turns solids into elemental particles. 
The nicely organized matter gets violently transformed into a chaotic cloud of dust.
This artillery is temperamental, and outcomes vary each time it is fired.
Like all good disintegration weapons, it is capable of making a target disappear.
Every target in the area of effect takes 24-192 (24d8) hit points in damage.
If the disintegration cascade starts, much more damage follows.

.*Disintegration Cascade*
. Area of effect inflicts 24-192 (24d8) hit points 
. Roll for 3-300 (3d100) kgs  of matter for disintegration.
. Roll percent (1d1000) to check for disintegration.
. Disintegration fails if the kilodie roll is less than the kgs of matter.
. If disintegration occurs, inflict catastrophic disintegration damage.

.*Disintegration Damage*
For most personas, disintegration is universally lethal.
If the persona's wate (kgs) is less than the kgs of matter disintegrated, she suffers total disintegration.
Total disintegration irrevocably destroys the persona, and she disappears into a cloud of dust.
If the persona's wate (kgs) is more than the kgs of matter disintegrated, she suffers partial disintegration.
Partial disintegration inflicts 1-20 (1d20) hit points in damage per kg destroyed.
For example, a 100 kg target loses 21 kgs of wate takes 24-192 (24d8) hit points of damage plus an additional 21d20 of damage.
If a persona manages to survive a partial disintegration, she will likely be missing essential body parts. 

The disintegration cascade failure only applies to organic targets. 
Robots, equipment, walls and structures automatically cascade. 
So a robot in the area of effect first takes 24-192 (24d8) hit points.
Then loses 3-300 (3d100) kgs of wate. 

A malfunction of this artillery disintegrates the cannon and damages the fire team.

=== Electron Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_electron_rifle[Electron Rifle]
Reload:: D
Range:: 1700h (17h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 15-150 (15d10)
Magazine:: 2 per Battery
Wate:: 315kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 750
Value:: 2000000 + Battery

An electron cannon blasts a beam of electrons massacring the target's molecules.
The cannon inflicts damage to every target in the area of effect.
An electron cannon's attack passes through force fields unhindered.
The blast damage harms both the force field and any target in the area of effect.
A malfunction of this cannon wastes all remaining charges.

=== Fission Artillery 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_fission_rifle[Fission Rifle,window=_blank]
Reload:: E
Range:: 1100h (11h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: 18-126 (18d12)
Magazine:: 3 per Battery
Wate:: 319kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 950
Value:: 32000000 + Battery

Fission artillery creates an energy wave that superheats hydrogen molecules.
This weapon only works in hydrogen-laden atmospheres (air and water).
Firing the rifle in the absence of hydrogen wastes a charge.
This device is thoroughly waterproof.

A malfunction will indicate a backflash, resulting in damage to the firer.

=== Howglitzer 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_full_auto_lazer_rifle[Full Auto Lazer Rifle,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u, 1u
Range:: 1200h (12h)

Damage:: 15-150 (15d10)
Magazine:: 15 per Battery
Wate:: 308kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 12000000 + Battery

The Howglitzer is a fully automated lazer cannon.
Like all artillery, each hit represents an area of effect.
When full auto is activated, the amount of damage becomes astronomical. 

The Howglitzer can fire once a unit (Shoot) 15 times in a row.
If there is an adequate battery charge, the Howglitzer can launch a volley of lazer attacks.
The F attack type releases 15 charges in one unit.
The player makes five attack rolls in one unit.
Each successful attack roll scores 1-3 (1d3) area of effect attacks.
It is possible to deliver 225-2250 hit points of damage in the area of effect.
Personas skilled in artillery may spread the area of effect hits to cover a larger area.

For a discussion of full auto (flotto) attacks jump to xref:combat:attack_types.adoc#_type_f_attacks[Flotto Attacks,window=_blank].

A more technical title would be a Full Auto Lazer Cannon or Flotto Lazer Artillery.

A malfunction of this artillery results in wasted charges and overheating damage.

=== Howblitzer 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_full_auto_rifle[Full Auto Rifle,window=_blank]

EXPS:: 700
Value:: 1200000 (25)

The Howblitzer is a rapid-fire howitzer to blitz the enemy with long-range carnage.
Like all artillery, each hit represents an area of effect.
When full auto is activated, the amount of damage becomes cataclysmic. 

The Howblitzer can fire once a unit (Shoot) 15 times in a row.
If there is enough ammunition, the Howblitzer can launch a barrage of attack rolls.
The F attack type releases 15 charges in one unit.
The player makes five attack rolls in one unit.
Each successful attack roll scores 1-3 (1d3) area of effect attacks.
It is possible to deliver 180-2160 hit points of damage in the area of effect.
Personas skilled in artillery may spread the area of effect hits to cover a larger area.

A malfunction represents a dud shell and a weapon jam.

=== Fusion Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_fusion_rifle[Fusion Rifle,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 900h (9h)
Area of Effect:: 9h swath
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 600kg (1kg + Battery)
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 8000000 (200000) + Battery

The fusion cannon launches a blob of fusion that creates a conflagration.
Fusion artillery casts a 900 by nine hex swath of incinerating death.

The first casualty of a fusion cannon is the battery crew.
Firing releases a fusion backflash that can deliver tremendous damage.
Those firing the fusion cannon take 18-180 (18d10) hit points in damage.
The backflash has a three hex area of effect.
Only personas sporting powered armour or special shielding are safe.

Target Size::
This weapon annihilates any persona large-sized or smaller.
Tiny, Small, Medium and Large targets explode and create collateral damage.
Gigantic targets do not explode. 
Gigantic targets take Swath and Collateral Damage. 

Swath Damage::
Swath damage delivers an inescapable area of effect damage along the path of the fusion blob.
Targets that do not instantly explode take swath damage.
The swath delivers 24-240 (24d10) hit points in damage.

Collateral Damage::
Everything exploded by the fusion cannon swath explodes outwards in collateral damage.
The boiling flesh and bits of bone hurtle outward from the swath path.
This steaming goo of collateral colleagues is three hexes on either side of the swath. 
Collateral damage inflicts 21-210 (21d10) hit points of damage.

A gigantic persona in the swath would take a combined swath and collateral damage, suffering 45-450 (45d10) hit points of damage.

A malfunction with the expedition eradicator will inflict 24-240 hit points of damage to all within 15 hexes.

=== Mag Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_gauss_rifle[Gauss Rifle,window=_blank]
Reload:: E
Range:: 1900h (19h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)

Magazine:: 3
Wate:: 281kg (5.6kg)
EXPS:: 754
Value:: 1200000 (500)

The mag cannon magnetically hurls specialized ammunition.
Each round is a combination of battery and projectile.
The battery expends its energy to propel itself at lethal velocity.
There are no casings ejected.
A mag cannon has little kickback.
The low kickback helps with the cannon's accuracy and utility in zero gravity.
The weapon is quiet but not entirely silent.

The mag cannon is also called a rail gun.

A malfunction indicates an ammo defect and weapon jam.

=== Whale Gun 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_grapple_gun[Grapple Gun,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 150h (2h)
Area of Effect:: None
Damage:: 12-72 (12d6)
Magazine:: 1
Wate:: 226kg
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 400000 (25)

The whale gun fires a giant adherent device attached to a high tensile cable.
The weapon firmly attaches the cable to enormous targets like spacecraft.
The business end is a combination of spikes, barbs and adherent materials.
A successful attack roll delivers the damage and connects the cannon to the target.

The whale gun can reel in a 10 tonnes object at five hu.
The whale gun must be mounted to a stable deck, or it will fly off.
If the target is too big, the whale gun will reel itself to the target.

The grapple end can be reeled back in over three units if the attack roll fails.

A malfunction with this weapon indicates a mechanism jam.

=== Grav Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_gravruptor_gun[Gravruptor Gun,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 300h (3h)
Area of Effect:: 2-12h (2d6)
Damage:: Special
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 293kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 700
Value:: 400000 + Battery

The grav cannon inflicts 3-12 (3d4) gravities of anomalous attraction.
The effect will either smash targets into the ground, throw them high into the air, or fling them off into space.
The grav cannon produces an instantaneous burst of random acceleration.
Newtonian physics conveniently need not apply.
The grav cannon is ineffective against targets with a wate greater than 5000kg.

.*Up*
25% of the time, the grav cannon reverses gravity by  3-12 (3d4) gravities.
Reversing gravity accelerates everything in the opposite direction to the present gravity.
The general effect is that things go flying into the air.
All items fly one hex into the air per anomalous gravity.
This acceleration inflicts 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points of damage per gravity of acceleration.
Hitting the ground inflicts an additional 1-6 (1d6) hit points per gravity.
Colliding with an immobile object along the path of the toss will also inflict 1-6 (1d6) hit points per gravity.

.*Down*
The remaining 75% of the time, the grav cannon will add  3-12 (3d4) gravities to the local terrain.
Increasing gravity causes personas to crash to the ground and vehicles to grind into the dirt.
This pressing problem will also inflict damage to all targets in the area of effect.
This damage is 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points in damage per extra gravity.
E.g., three gravities would smash targets into the ground for 3-36 (3d12) hit points of damage.

.*All Around*
This weapon is a ZOG (zero gravity) combat weapon.
The grav cannon flings enemy combatants off into space.
All targets accelerate away from the epicentre at  3-12 (3d4) gravities.
This acceleration inflicts 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points of damage per gravity of acceleration.
The targets are also flying away at one h/u for every 2 points of damage.
Consider a grav cannon that generated five gravities to the area of effect.
The referee generates 24 HPS of damage using 5d12.
Each target subtracts 24 HPS from their HPS Total and is flying away at
12 h/u.

The grav cannon is also known as an accelerator or a gravity cannon.

A malfunction with this weapon will result in a gravitational anomaly attacking the weapon and artillery team.


=== Garbage Cannon 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_job_rifle[Job Rifle,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 1000h (10h)

Damage:: 9-90 (9d10)
Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 300kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 17500 + Battery

The garbage cannon employs a combination gauss, spring and vacuum chamber mechanism.
This complicated mechanism allows the cannon to turn any solid material into a lethal projectile.

To load the weapon, place 10kg of loose material into the chamber.
Sand, rocks, plastic, batteries, or bullets will hurtle out with lethal velocity.
Each 10 kgs load of detritus is fired all at once.

A garbage cannon has no specific ammunition. 
This weapon is also called a job cannon, junk gun or garbage can.
JOB is an acronym for Jack Of all Bullets.

A malfunction with this weapon indicates a weapon jam. 

=== Lazer Cannon

Magazine:: 1 per Battery
Wate:: 278kg (Battery)
EXPS:: 500
Value:: 600000 + Battery

The lazer cannon is a giant coherent light energy weapon.
The lazer cannon is the staple of epic sciency fiction across the galaxy.
The gun makes the classic pinging, zapping or crackling noise.
Ionized gasses ejected from the emission chamber create a hefty kickback.

The previous version's description of this weapon "Zap Zap. Boom Boom."

A malfunction indicates the loss of a charge.


=== Miscellaneator 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: Some xref:hardware:armaments.adoc[Miscellaneous Weapon,window=_blank]
Reload:: Special
Range:: 10 times (1/10 minimum)
Area of Effect:: 3 times or 2-12h 
Damage:: 3 times highest
Magazine:: C=1 D=2 E=3 F=15
Wate:: 75 times heaviest Ammo % or 50 times
EXPS:: Same
Value:: 100 times

The miscellaneator is a super-sized version of a miscellaneous weapon.
This artillery is a cartoony mad scientist version of an already odd weapon.
The players will have to be deft in finding balance and sanity with this weapon.
The miscellaneator gets very zany, very fast.

TIP: Rules maintain game balance and assist creativity. +
*Do not let rules get in the way of the story or the fun.*

Miscellaneator could be a black hole, a gigantic spinning wheel of death, or a flare cannon.
Depending on the milieu of the campaign, certain giantified weapons may not work.
For example, a giant compucrafted sword only makes sense in some realities. 
If this type of weapon would imbalance a campaign or mess up a milieu, simply ignore it.
Story trumps die rolling chaos.

=== Immolator 

[horizontal]
Base Weapon:: xref:hardware:guns.adoc#_napalm_gun[Napalm Gun,window=_blank]
Reload:: 6u
Range:: 150h

Magazine:: 1 
Wate:: 338kg (15kg)
EXPS:: 900
Value:: 1200000 (20000)

This flame thrower, aka the Immolator, bathes everything in a three by 150 hex swath with sticky burning goo.

The immolator sprays a jet of flaming adhesive death.
The jet from the flame thrower covers a 150 by three hex swath area of effect.
The area of effect is a straight line, and the gunnery team cannot sweep the attack over an arc.
Everything caught inside the one hex wide path will take 30-300 (10d30) hit points of damage.

All objects capable of burning have a chance of bursting into flames.
The percentage chance of immolating is equal to the damage rolled.
If a target were to take 64 hit points in damage, it would have a 64% chance of bursting into flames.
Targets that are set alight will burn for 1 to 10 units.
Each unit of burning will inflict an additional 2 to 20 (2d10) hit points of damage.

This weapon is also labelled the napalm cannon, forest firer and flame thrower.

Usually, a malfunction indicates a mechanism jam, but occasionally it may cause the immolator to explode.

=== Plasma Cannon

The muckmaker tears apart protein structures in organic tissue.
The area of effect blast unravels collagen, melts bone, and liquefies flesh.
This weapon is an anti-organic weapon.
Inorganic personas are unaffected as the disrupting ray passes through them unimpeded.
The beam passes unimpeded through robots, walls, Argillan rock women, and armour.
Machines and personas with organic components may be affected by this attack.
Wounds from this weapon are a gory mush.
Typical veterinarian quick fixes are ineffective.
A vet must have access to biorepair equipment to repair these wounds. 

A malfunction of this weapon attacks the battery crew.
