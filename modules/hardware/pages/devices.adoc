If no obvious description comes to mind jump to xref:hardware:appearance.adoc[Appearances,window=_blank].

=== Parameters

==== Vocation 
Vocation represents the persona vocation best suited for the device.
If the vocation attribute indicates Mechanic, then the artifact is used by mechanics.
If the artifact vocation is labelled Spie, then it is an artifact for spying.
If the vocation is labelled None, then it sits in no particular vocation category.

==== Duration 
Duration indicates how much use the device can endure before the user must replace the battery set.
It would be unusual for a battery set to run down, but who knows, it may happen just when the device is most needed!
Other toys have a predetermined number of uses before the user must replace the battery set.
Single-use artifacts usually consume themselves to reach their objective.
Artifacts with the duration of Power Source need a connection to a  power source like a wall outlet or a generator.
These are artifacts that require enormous power plants like nuclear generators and hydroelectric dams.

==== Wate 
The wate parameter lists the wate of the device in kilograms.
This parameter is added to the persona's wate allowance if she is carrying the artifact.

==== EXPS
The experience point value is for the persona, or personas, who correctly identifies the device. Identification can occur before or after the device is used.

==== Value
The value parameter is how many electrum pieces the device is worth. The value of a device may be priceless in certain situations of milieus.

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: 120 Hour per Battery
Wate:: 2kg
EXPS:: 200
Value:: Special

Absorbers are capable of eliminating environmental components that are harmful to organic creatures.
The absorbers are industrial-strength air cleaners that counteract harmful agents like radiation, gas, and smoke.
The devices all operate on unknown electrochemical and mechanical principles that allow the referee to ignore any problems regarding the laws of conservation of mass.
All absorbers have the same specifications and abilities.
They eliminate the substance in question in a non-violent manner.

They have a three hex radius of effect in which the toxic material will have absolutely no effect.
For instance, a radiation absorber would reduce the effects of radiation __within__ the three hex area of effect for the duration of the battery set.
The absorber will also clean up an area around itself by drawing in and neutralizing the offending substance.
The absorbers reduce the duration and area of effect to 1/4 of expected.
Substances like smoke, radiation and gas clouds drop to 1/4 of their area of effect and duration.
For those absorbers that can absorb damage, each HPS of damage absorbed counts as 1 hour of battery life.

There is a 90% chance that the dehydration will be successful.
A biologist can increase the chance of success by 1% per DD maneuver.
Dehydration is never risk-free, and a 1d100 roll is essential.
A roll of 42 indicates the dehydration has failed.

Failure of dehydration is not evident until rehydration.
Failed dehydration affects organic and inorganic objects differently.
A failed organic object will acquire 0-3 (1d4-1) xref:wetware:phenomics.adoc#_defective_mutations[Defective Phenomic Mutations,window=_blank].
The mutations are present on rehydration. 
A failed inorganic sample rehydrates into a cacophony of random primary materials.

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mechanic
Duration:: Single Use
Wate:: 1 kg
EXPS:: 299
Value:: 2000

Plastix explosive is an anti-architectural shape charge.
Each charge is moldable to optimized structural damage.
The plastix explosive is safe to work with and can be frozen or liquefied without the risk of detonation.
The explosive has no effective range.
Personas can stand directly beside the explosion with no fear of damage (says the manufacturer).
The debris field or building collapse would be a different story.
In short, this is the safest, most destructive, commercial explosive made.
Plastix is nearly impossible to weaponize, but it often gives a tactical advantage.

One kg of plastix will blow one hex-sized hole in any civilian architectural structure.
Flying debris can be a problem for those caught on the wrong side of a charge (say inside a room).
Technically the plastix explosive imparts 1000 HPS of damage.
A mercenary or mechanic with demolitions skill must apply the plastix to inflict full damage.
All other personas applying the plastix will only inflict 100-600 (1d6*100) hit points of damages.
If 1000 HPS equals a one hex hole, less damage will produce a proportionally smaller hole.

To properly apply plastix explosive requires a mechanic DD4 maneuver.
Detonation of plastix explosives is easy to achieve.
Accidental detonation of plastix explosive is nearly impossible.
There is a 5% chance that the plastique will be silent, doubling its value.
There is also a 15% chance that the plastique will be smokeless, increasing its value by 10%.
Usually, a cache contains 1-8 kg (1d8) of plastix explosive.

=== Psionic Headband 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: Self Powered
Wate:: 500gms
EXPS:: 590
Value:: 9900611

The psionic headband amplifies an organic persona's psionic abilities.
The psionic headband must be close to the brain and contact the skin.
This artifact does not change the persona's Mind attribute.
However, it does improve the persona's psionic effectiveness.
This artifact doubles the parameters of uncombat mutation effects.
A uncombat mutation with a range of 10 hexes would have a range of 20 hexes.
The persona increases her Mind by 50% when making mental attacks.
For psionic defence, the headband doubles the persona's MND.
The fortified defensive MND of the wearer cannot be less than 15.

A knite cannot wear a psionic headband. 
The knite's connection with the thinkspace must be pure and uninhibited by machines.

=== Recorders

=== Robot 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mechanic
Duration:: Special
Wate:: Special
EXPS:: Special
Value:: Special

The persona is now controlling a robot.
Initially, this will be a functioning robot that follows the instructions of the persona.
As the robot becomes more damaged, it will likely evolve into a referee persona.
Some robots, like Datalyzers and Hobbots, are cheeky from the start.
A robot is more like an amicable referee persona than a slave.
The players shouldn't use the robot to upset the balance of the game.
Using a robot to destroy plot points will accelerate its acquisition of consciousness.

=== Robotic Override 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mechanic
Duration:: 5 Uses per Battery
Wate:: 18kg
EXPS:: 2006
Value:: 994000

The robotic override is a focused computer that can reprogram the purpose and ownership of a target robot.
The robotic override connects with the target robot via a full-contact attack or ranged attack.
There is no question that robotic override is anything other than an attack.
The robot must win a roll vs poison intensity 3-30 (3d10) or succumb to the override.
The robot uses its Intelligence attribute to combat the programming poison, not her Constitution.
Mechanics can increase the intensity of the attack by winning task rolls.

Once controlled, the user of the robotic override controls the robot.
The personas can order a combot to clean sidewalks or a hobbot to ram targets.
Persona robots get to make a control factor check every day they are under foreign control.
The more egregious the abuse, the more likely the persona robot is to break free from override.

NOTE: *Persona robots pronounce overridden as overwritten.*

Mechanics earn a bonus of +20 when making robot-related rolls using this device.

==== Full Contact Override (Strike Attack)
The mechanic must get up close and personal with the robot.
The override is the full contact type 68% of the time.
The player must win a Strike attack with the override to inject the override coding.
Some robots are very hard to win an attack roll against, making them resistant to override.
For docile, non-evasive, robots there is no need for the attack roll. 
The pick does not have an 18kg wate, but the pick, cable and backpack do.

==== Ranged Override (Shoot Attack)
The mechanic can beam the override computations from up to 10 hexes away.
The override is the ranged type the remaining 42% of the time.
The player must win a Shoot attack with the override to inject the override coding.
For docile, non-evasive, robots there is no need for the attack roll.


=== Rocket Rollerskates 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: 1000 km per Battery
Wate:: 4 kg each
EXPS:: 99
Value:: 12000

Rocket rollerskates propel the persona along the ground faster than regular rollerskates.
The skates have a gyroscopically stabilized truck system which helps prevents crashes.
The skates are landlocked and do *not* fly.
They also require a reasonably smooth surface.
They work best on proper roads in civilized areas.

This device only works in pairs (not impaired).
One cannot skate with just one rocket rollerskate. 
The plural is essential.

The skates are fast and move at 31 to 50 (1d20+30) hexes per unit.
When necessary, their handling class is equal to the wearer's DEX.
Dangerous moves will require the player to win driving rolls or crash.

There is a 10% chance that a rocket roller skates will be an identically functioning skateboard.
If the player so desires, the rocket roller skate could be a rocket skateboard instead.


=== Scopes

:description: Two boxy shaped and one telescope shaped rifle scopes
include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

A scope is a device that aids the player's attack roll.
Artifact scopes range from a sight mounted on a rifle to a gyroscope on a sword.
If the device helps increases the chance of damaging the target, it is a scope.
There are scopes for all weapon types. 
Every scope has an attack roll bonus and a specialization.

.*Scope Checklist*
. Scope Attack Type
. Scope Attack Roll Bonus
. Scope Base Value
. Scope Feature

==== Scope Attack Type
Each scope works with a specific attack type. 
The scope is not interchangeable, and the technology only works on its designated weapon type.
A scope designed for thrusting and striking weapons would not look like a rifle scope.
A scope for Strike weapons could be a box on the hilt or a bracelet.
The scope would then modify the motion of the blade to improve the attack roll.

include::hardware:partial$scope_attack_type.adoc[]

==== Scope Attack Roll Bonus
.1d4 times 30 (1d4*30)
****
The attack roll bonus is +30, +60, +90, or +120
****

The player adds the bonus to her final attack roll.
A scope allows the player to exceed the persona's Max Roll (Max).
For example, a persona with a Max Roll of 710 could generate an attack roll of 800 with a +90 scope.

==== Scope Base Value
The value of this scope is equal to 1000 per to hit bonus.
A scope with +90 to hit is worth 90 000.

==== Scope Specialization
Scope Specialization determines what unique feature the scope has.
The unique ability of the scope works in uncombat situations.
A player can look down a scope to see through the smoke at any time.

include::hardware:partial$scope_feature_type.adoc[]

==== Auto strike
This scope compensates for virtually any error that the persona can make in combat.
An autoscope is the cheat code equivalent for a weapon.
The scope must have line of sight and cannot shoot through cover, concealment or severe weather.
The player must still make an attack roll.

A successful attack roll becomes a critical hit. 
Jump to xref:uncombat:critical_checks.adoc#_critical_hit[Critical Hits,window=_blank].
A miss on the attack roll becomes a regular hit.
A weapon malfunction is the only way to miss.

There is an *EXPS penalty* for using an autoscope. 
Combat experience is reduced to 10% using the autoscope. 
The value of this artifact is 10000 times the base attack bonus.

==== Climate 
The climate scope compensates for all meteorological conditions except darkness.
The scope removes all penalties for wind, fog, rain, snow etc. 
The climate scope is worth double the base value of the scope.

==== Darkness
This night scope cancels penalties for darkness.
The scope uses a combination of IR, UV, and whatever else helps the darkened attack.
The darkness scope does not give up its position unless intentionally detected. 
There is no value bonus for a darkness scope.

==== Gravity 
The gravity scope allows the weapon to be unimpeded by 0 to 8 gravities.
In ZOG, the scope compensates for kickback and protects its user from being thrown around.
This scope is exatmo hardened.
The gravity specialization triples the value of this scope. 

==== Multi-scope 
The multi-scope is a combination of multiple scopes into a single artifact.
So a multi-scope could be a climate and darkness scope.
Each scope gets another roll on the attack rolls bonus section. 
So multi-scope made up of +60 climate, and +90 Darkness would have a +150 attack bonus.
It would also attack cleanly in any weather or darkness.
Each visit to multi-scope adds another scope to a maximum of three scopes and a maximum attack roll bonus of +250.
The value of a multi-scope is the combined value of the scopes times 10. 

==== Pacifist
The pacifist scope is a non-lethal auto strike scope.
The scope determines a target's most vulnerable points.
Instead of delivering a killing attack, the pacifist scope delivers a debilitating attack.
A pacifist scope has an attack roll bonus, like all other scopes.

After a successful attack roll, the player rolls damage. 
The pacifist scope converts the damage into a percent chance to stun the opponent.
Each point of damage inflicted will have a 2% chance of stunning the target for 0 to 9 (1d10-1) units.
A pacifist scope does not work with area of effect weapons or weapons of malicious destruction.
For example, this scope does not work with a fusion pistol or flame thrower.
The value of the scope is increased by 1000000.

==== Range
Range scopes increase the effective range of the weapon.
The range extender scope doubles the weapon's range and halves the decay.
The scope optimizes a projectile's decay by compensating for wind and gravity effects.
A weapon with a range of 50 and decay of -100 improves to a range of 100 and a decay of -50.
For Strike attacks, the range extender allows the weapon to make a Fling attack with a range of STR in hexes.
There is no increased value for a range extender scope.

==== Smoke
The smoke cutting scope can sight through mist, fog, smoke, and other gaseous obfuscations.
The player suffers no attack roll penalties in smoke when using this scope. 
There is no value modifier with a smoke scope.

=== Sincerity Machine 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Nothing
Duration:: 1 year per Battery
Wate:: 1 kg
EXPS:: 230
Value:: 2000

The sincerity machine improves the persona's Charisma by manipulating the voice.
A sub-linguistic vocalization analyzer modifies the persona's voice such that anything she says sounds nice.
The effect is excellent for negotiation, and during talks increases the persona's Charisma by 3-8 (1d6+2).
A persona can alter the sincerity machine to have a reverse effect which will get the expected reaction.
When combined with good looks, and clever wording, even coarse profanities sound like compliments.
A vet will earn a bonus of +15 for all rolls on conscious patients.
This device does not work with powered armour.

This Charisma boost does not alter the persona's Charisma attribute. 
If the machine loses power, all Charisma bonuses immediately disappear.

include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

The superconductor suit is a skintight jumpsuit that improves Dexterity.
Typically the superconductor suit is worn underneath clothing or armour.
However, the superconductor suit is rather stylish on its own.
The superconductor threads include sensitive biotransceivers
The transceivers pick up nerve impulses and bypass the regular nervous system along superconducting threads.
The suit allows the persona to react faster and move faster, improving the persona's Dexterity.
The suit has a DEX bonus of plus 3-8 (1d6+2) points.
This device does not work with powered armour.

This device does not permanently change the persona's Dexterity attribute.
Once removed or damaged, the persona returns to her normal DEX attribute value.
The suit is delicate and is damaged every time the persona is damaged. 
For gameplay, the suit usually starts with 1000 hit points.
Once reduced to zero HPS, it stops conducting. 

=== Materiel

Materiel is artifacts that exist to make other artifacts shine.
Types of materiel are batteries, ammunition, fuel, manuals, software and spare parts.
Materiel does not have a function on its own. 
However, some materiel is precious.

It is also reasonable to have materiel align with existing expedition artifacts.
For example, a player may roll extra batteries for her lazer pistol.
Or one persona may have the software for another persona's vocation computer.

Take a jump over to xref:hardware:materiel.adoc[Materiel,window=_blank].

=== Targeting Computer 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Mercenary
Duration:: 50 uses per Battery
Wate:: 20.8 kg
EXPS:: 395
Value:: 900000

A targeting computer helps aim artillery or missiles. 
The persona targets the artillery using the binoculars wired to the artillery box.
The targeting computer either moves the weapon on a platform or barks directions.

Non-mercenary vocations can use a targeting computer to fire artillery. 
They cannot fire on moving targets and get no attack roll bonuses.
Under normal circumstances, personas not trained in artillery cannot use it.

A mercenary using a targeting computer can target moving objects like vehicles or whales.
When firing on a stationary target, the mercenary gets an attack roll bonus of +100.
There is no bonus awarded when firing on moving targets.
Computer targeting is much faster than manual targeting, only taking 1-10 (1d10) units.
The targeting computer gives mercenaries and mechanics +20 on any artillery-related rolls.

=== Tesseract Box 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: None
Duration:: Approach Infinity
Wate:: Approach Infinity
EXPS:: 42
Value:: Special

A tesseract box is a multi-roomed artifact that appears small and mundane on its outside.
A tesseract box only occupies one hex of physical space.
On the inside, the tesseract box can contain 100s of medium-sized rooms. 
A tesseract box is a campaign-altering artifact.
It would not be uncommon to find referee personas inside the tesseract box. 
Such an artifact can be the basis of a campaign or even an entire sciency fiction series.

A tesseract box will have 100 to 1000 (1d10*100) rooms arranged in whatever fashion the referee sees fit.
These rooms are not in the physical space but may exist in the interstitium of physical space (aka xref:appendices:generic_mythos.adoc#_the_spaces[hyperspace,window=_blank]).
The rooms are only accessible through the tesseract box entrance. 
Any items brought into the tesseract box must fit through the single exterior opening, and that is a normal-sized door.

A tesseract box can be fitted with a xref:hardware:spacecraft.adoc#_special_drives[Special Drive,window=_blank].
Since the box has a special relationship with hyperspace, its jump drive can travel further than usual jump drives.
The box cannot have any other kind of spacecraft drive, as the box has far too much wate.
No external force can move a tesseract box.
The box has incalculable wate but does not influence local gravity.

The value of a tesseract box is irrelevant because no owner will part with hers until she is dead.n

=== Timepieces 

[horizontal]
Vocation:: Nothing

The visual aids are a host of goggles that help persona's through the darkness, smoke, or worse.
Visual aids are often called vizauds, vizaids, optical enhancers or happy goggles.

include::hardware:partial$visual_aid_types.adoc[]

Binox:: 
These are electronic binoculars that allow the persona to see further and with greater detail.
The user can adjust the magnification, and the device will give the range of significant objects.
Binox are passive and have no detectable emissions.
Binoculars are worth 100. 

Flexiscope::
The flexiscope is a flexible light pipe.
The light pipe can be bent in any direction allowing the persona to look around corners.
This device easily attaches to other vizauds.
The flexiscope is worth 1100.  

Infrared::  
These goggles allow the persona to see things in the dark.
They employ infrared imaging tech to do so.
IR visual aids have a value of 500.

Macroscopic::
Macroscopic goggles use computers and lenses to increase the persona's field of view. 
The goggles are perfect for finding things on open plains or exatmo.
They are flash-protected and blinding attacks are ineffective.
These goggles grant the persona a +10 on any ambush detection rolls made.
Macroscopic goggles are worth 20000  

Microscopic::
These glasses are very much like microscopes attached to the eyes.
They allow the persona to zoom in on small areas and expand the image thousands of times.
Microscopic goggles give a persona +20 on any miniature-related rolls.
Binocular microscopic goggles are worth 10000.

NIX Magic Multi-Vision Visor:: 
The NIX corporation makes incredibly complex and comprehensive equipment.
The multi-vision visor is so detailed that no one knows precisely what it does.
All M2V2s will have infrared, binox, and anti-flash screens as standard.
Other visual aids may also be present, smoke cutting, x-ray vision, ultravision, macroscopic, and microscopic.
There is a 17% chance that a particular visual aid will be present.
For example, if the persona needs radar there is a 17% radar vision will be present.
The vision type may not be present the next time, but it may present the time after that.
Nix Magic Multi-Vision Visor is worth 10000000. 

Smoke::
The smoke-cutting visor allows the persona to function as though there was no smoke obscuring her vision.
The scope works equally well with mist, fog, and other particulate matter.
The smoke will still asphyxiate the persona, but it does so without visual impairment.
The smoke visor is worth 250.

Ultravision:: 
These goggles allow the persona to see things in the dark.
They employ ultraviolet imaging tech to do so.
UV visual aids have a value of 500.

X-Ray:: 
The wearer can adjust the x-ray goggles to see inside things at various depths.
They have a range of 1 hex and can penetrate up to one hex of hull metal.

A waste disposer is an entirely safe disintegration device (or so the manufacturer says).
Waste is placed into a drawer, the drawer is closed, and the trash is disintegrated with a poof noise.
The drawer can handle up to 25 kg of waste at a time.
The disintegrator will open the drawer and eject any living materials or moving objects.
The disintegrator harnesses energy released from the previously disintegrated materials.
There will always be just enough energy for the subsequent disintegration.
The waste disposer will disintegrate itself if subject to tampering.
