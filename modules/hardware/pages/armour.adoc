= Armour

Armour protects the wearer from damage in combat and other harsh environments. 
Artifact armour can have technomagical qualities that vary from thermal protection to computerized, servo-aided joints.
Unless otherwise stated, the armour will include torso, limb, hand, foot, and head protection.
Armour does not include shields.

=== Description
Armour is pretty obviously armour.
At very high tech levels artifact armour may be mistaken for clothing, or jewelry.
Other times biomech powered armour can mistaken for robot parts.  
If colour and other appointments are needed jump to xref:hardware:appearance.adoc[Appearances,window=_blank].

=== Parameters

==== Defence Rating 
The higher the Defence Rating, the better the protection offered to the wearer.
Not all the armour in this chapter has a high Defence Rating, but each offers some unique form of special protection.

The base Defence Rating of an unarmoured target is 500.
The armour ratings are related to this base value.
For instance, a suit of armour with an Defence Rating of 725 would give the wearer a base Defence Rating of 725 instead of 500.

==== Restrictiveness 
The more restrictive a suit of armour is, the more cumbersome and unyielding it is to normal body movement.
The more cumbersome the armour, the higher its restrictiveness.
The less restrictive armour is, the more that the persona can use her Dexterity to avoid taking damage.

==== Wate
The wate of armour is unnecessarily complicated.
The wate includes a number followed by another number in brackets.
The first number is a percentage.
The second number is the total wate of this armour for a 70 kgs anthro persona.

The percentage value helps the referee when fabricating armour for aliens or robots. 
The total wate of the armour will be the percentage of the wearer's wate.
If the percentage wate is 2.5% and the wearer has a wate of 100 kgs, the armour's wate is 2.5 kgs.
The value in brackets is the armour's wate for a 70 kgs anthro, or 1.5 kgs).

==== EXPS 
This value is the number of Experience points the persona earns for identifying the armour's unique function.

==== Value 
The value of armour is unnecessarily complicated.
The value includes a number followed by another number in brackets.
The first number is a value per kilogram.
The second number is the value of this armour for a 70 kgs anthro persona.

The value per kilogram helps the referee when fabricating armour for aliens and robots.
The value of a suit of ablative armour is 590 eps per kilogram of armour wate.
So a three-kilogram suit of ablative armour is worth 1770 eps.
The standard value for a 70 kgs anthro persona is 900 eps.
 

== Armour Catalogue

=== Ablative

[horizontal]
Defence Rating:: 625
Restrictiveness:: 3
Wate:: 2.5 (1.5kg)
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 590/kg (900)

Ablative armour negates lazer attacks.
When hit by a lazer, the ablative material vaporizes, producing an anti-lazer gas that dissipates the lazer bolt, keeping the attack from damaging the wearer.
When hit by a lazer, the wearer will take no damage because of the ablative armour.
This armour only works against lazers and does not affect energy attacks such as fission, fusion, or plasma.
The Defence Rating represents how well the armour is at deflecting all other attacks.
Since the armour vaporizes to disrupt lazers, it has a limited lifespan.
The armour will lose its ablative effect after disrupting 300-1000 (1d8+2 x 100) hit points of lazer damage.
If a lazer attack scores a hit, the damage score harms the armour, not the wearer.
Depleted ablative armour retains its AR of 625 but loses all special defences against lazers.

=== Ballistic

[horizontal]
Defence Rating:: 625
Restrictiveness:: 3
Wate:: 2.9 (2kg)
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 590/kg (1200)

Ballistic armour negates ballistic attacks.
A crisscrossing mat of super-dense polymers absorbs high-velocity projectile damage (bullets, fragments, etc.).
Ballistic armour can absorb 100-600 (1d6 times 100) hit points of high velocity (Shoot attacks) damage.
Once the armour has sustained this maximum damage, it will be unable to negate projectile damage but maintains its AR of 625.
Ballistic cloth does not absorb damage from low-velocity attacks such as punches, maces, pipes, flails, etc.

=== Combat

[horizontal]
Defence Rating:: 725
Restrictiveness:: 2
Wate:: 3.0 (2kg)
EXPS:: 100
Value:: 1000/kg (2000)

Combat armour is typical futuristic, militaristic body protection designed for infantry dogmeat.
It is usually composed of such mundane materials as Kevlar weaves and ceramic plates.

=== Compucrafted

[horizontal]
Defence Rating:: Plus 30-120 (3d4 times 10)
Restrictiveness:: 0-3 (1d4-1)
Wate:: Halved
EXPS:: 300 
Value:: See below

Compucrafted armour is computer-designed versions of mundane armour types.
They are designed to handle stress better, deflect blows better, be less restrictive, and have less wate.
Compucrafted armour uses special alloys, plastics, and ceramics, unlike the mundane equivalents.

include::hardware:partial$compucrafted_armour.adoc[]

The Defence Rating (DEF) increases by 30-120 (3d4 x 10) from the base Defence Rating.
Lighter and less cumbersome materials allow for more unrestricted body movement.
The lighter design decreases the armour's restrictiveness to between 0-3 (1d4-1).
The new restrictiveness cannot be higher than armour's previous restrictiveness.
Compucrafted armour reduces its wate by half and increases its value four times.
EXPS value is a flat 300 points for all types of compucrafted armour.

=== Concussion

[horizontal]
Defence Rating:: 625
Restrictiveness:: 3
Wate:: 2.9 (2kg)
EXPS:: 200
Value:: 590/kg (1200)

Concussion armour absorbs concussive forces.
The protection looks like a bulky, pillowy onesie.
Each of the fluffy lumps is full of tiny resilient beads that increase the surface area that concussion force is absorbed over.

=== Force Field

[horizontal]
Defence Rating:: 0
Restrictiveness:: 0
Wate:: Table
EXPS:: 500
Value:: Table

Force field belts generate a nearly invisible defensive shield contoured to the wearer's body.
The electromagically generated field dissipates kinetic energy protecting the wearer.
The belt will absorb any attack that uses energy (kinetic, lazer, clubs).
The field raises instantly when an incoming attack is detected.
The force field belt absorbs any damage that the wearer would have taken.
This force field does not stop poison gas, radiation, kisses or psionic attacks.

The accessory is usually an artifact baked right into the helmet.
The artifact could be a gun, vet equipment, or a scope.
The persona controls the artifact using voice command, tongue wrangling, or facial contortions.
The milieu of the campaign determines the base helmet type.

Regardless of the helmet type, the AR bonus is the same. 
Helmets do not affect restrictiveness. 
The baked-in artifact determines the wate and value of the helmet.

The type of equipment installed is limited by wate and reason.
Heavy artifacts would not only be impractical but would cause severe neck injury.
The table is an abbreviated list of equipment that may be useful in a combat helmet.
