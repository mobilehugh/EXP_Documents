== Gun Data

=== Power Level
Power level is a generic term for calibre or the weapon.
Power level could be the diameter of the bullet or the amount of lazer force each attack delivers.
The default power level is medium power, and only if a change is needed is this table used.
There are five different power levels, and the most common is medium power.

=== Description
Guns typically look like rifles or pistols. 
Very low tech or very high tech guns may have unique shapes. 
To modify a toys' description jump to xref:hardware:appearance.adoc[Appearances,window=_blank].

=== Parameters

==== Attack Type 
The attack types indicate the frequency of attack that the powered projectile weapon has.
Attack Shoot has one attack roll per unit.
Attack Types D and E have two and three attack rolls per unit.
Attack Flotto is for Full auto, and the player makes five attack rolls per unit with some special rules. 
For all the deets jump to xref:combat:attack_types.adoc[Attack Types,window=_blank].

==== Range 
The range is how far the weapon can shoot and retain its accuracy.
The range is a hardware limitation and does not reflect the skills of the persona in any way.
The weapon's range is limited by wavering bullets, dissipating charges, or decaying material.

The range lists a number and a negative number in brackets, 120h (-230).
The first number is the range in hexes where there are no range penalties.
The number in brackets is the per hex penalty for targets beyond the weapons range (first number).

A weapon has the following range parameters 120h (-230).
The persona can shoot any target within 120 hexes with no penalties.
A target 121 hexes away has a -230 attack roll penalty.
A target 123 hexes away has a -690 attack roll penalty.

The range parameters of 100h (-1000) indicate a weapon with a maximum range of 100 hexes and no further.

The number in brackets was previously called the decay value of the weapon.

==== Accuracy 
Accuracy simply reflects the accuracy of the gun.
The better balanced and better designed the weapon, the easier it is to hit the target.
The player adds the accuracy parameter of the gun to her attack roll.
A weapon with an accuracy of +50 adds +50 to every kilodie roll the player makes with the weapon. 

==== Damage 
Damage is the number of hit points the weapon subtracts from the target with a successful attack roll.
Most often, the damage parameter is a number range with the suggested die roll in brackets.
For example, 4-48 (4d12) indicates a weapon that inflicts 4-48 hit points of damage, and four twelve-sided dice will generate the value.
If there is a list of five different damage ranges, such as 5-60, 5-50, 4-48, 3-30, 2-20, then the weapon has power levels.

==== Magazine 
The magazine lists the number of attack rolls before having to reload.
Emptying the magazine can mean using up all the bullets, expending all the fuel or draining the battery.
A gun with a magazine of 45 can shoot 45 rounds before the persona must reload.

==== Wate 
Wate lists the unloaded wate of the gun in kilograms.
There are several different parameters for wate.
The first number is the wate of the weapon, and the number in parenthesis is the wate of the ammunition.

The weapon wate is usually a single number, but weapons with different power levels (calibres) have three values.
The first wate is for high powered versions, the middle wate is for the medium powered version, and the last wate is for low powered versions.
For example, 4.62, *2.75*, and 1.95 represent 4.63 kgs for the high powered version (XHP and HP), 2.75 kgs for the medium powered version (MP) and 1.95 kgs for the low powered versions (LP and XLP)

The ammunition wate is usually a single value in brackets.
If the value is a percentage (like 1.5%), the ammunition wate is a percentage of the weapon wate.
If the value is a precise wate (200 gms), the ammunition wate is specifically that amount.
If the value in the brackets says (battery), the ammunition wate is that of a battery (usually 100 gms).
If the value in the brackets says (fuel), the ammunition wate is that of the fuel (usually negligible).

Ammunition wate is for encumbrance purists.

==== EXPS 
The persona wins this experience point award for identifying the gun. 
The player may identify the gun by deduction or firing. 

==== Value 
The value indicates the MSRP (Money Suggested in RolePlaying) of the gun in eps.
The value in brackets is the value of the ammunition in eps.

include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

The beegun's activation chamber excites a normally docile insect into a poisonous rage.
After two units of warming up, the beegun is ready to fire.
If the player wins an attack roll, the insect will inject a deadly and instantaneous poison.
The target must save vs intensity 19 to 24 (18+d6) poison or die.
If the player wins the saving roll, her persona will be comatose for 1-4 days.
The ammunition for a beegun is not reusable.

:description: Futuristic pistol with square large barrel.
include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

A cryogun precipitously drops the temperature creating ice, snow and death.
This weapon inflicts both damage and freezes the target in place.
Every target within the 15h x 2h swath suffers the damage.

Damage is rolled once for the entire attack.
There is also a chance that targets will get frozen in place.
The chance of being entrapped is 1% per hit point of damage.
With 15 hit points, there is a 15% chance of trapping a medium-sized in ice.
There would also be a 15% chance of freezing swords in scabbards, buttons in the on position, steering wheels straight ahead, etc.
The chance of freezing must be checked for each target.

The freezing effects of a cryogun will melt away in 6 to 60 units.
Heating will halve the melting time.

This weapon is also known as a Frigid Aire or a cop gun (they don't have to yell "freeze." They just pull the trigger).

A malfunction results in the loss of a charge.

The death ray pistol attacks the electrochemical life force of organic creatures.
The beam attack must score a hit to be effective.
The death ray inflicts 2-16 (2d8) hit points of damage plus a good chance of death.
Any target hit by the death ray must save versus intensity 3-24 (3d8) poison or die.
The intensity of the killing attack is generated every time the weapon is fired.

This weapon is also called a kill-o-zap gun or a terminator.

The malfunction of this weapon will occasionally call for an attack on the firer.
Normal malfunctions result in the loss of all remaining charges.

The disintegration gun turns solids into elemental particles. 
The nicely organized matter turns into a cloud of dust.
This weapon is very temperamental, and outcomes vary each time the trigger is pulled.
Like all good disintegration weapons it is capable of making a target disappear.
The cascade of disintegration only begins if a hit is scored on a target.
A miss will not result in a disintegration cascade.
Every target hit will take the assigned 8-64 (8d8) hit points in damage.
If the disintegration cascade starts much more damage follows.

.*Disintegration Cascade*
Each attack has a chance of disintegrating it's target. 
The disintegration cascade will affect 1-100 (1d100) kgs of wate.
The amount of disintegrated matter is unique each time.
The greater the amount of matter affected the greater the chance the cascade will fail.
There is a 1% chance per kg of matter that the attack will fail.

So an attack that is affecting 42 kgs of a target has a 42 percent chance of failing.
Basically the player immediately rolls the 1d100 again. 
If the second roll is greater than the amount of wate things disintegrate.
Using the above example of a 42 kg cascade the player immediately rolls again.
If the roll is 42 or higher, the cascade is successful and 42 kgs disappears.
If the roll is 41 or lower the cascade fails and the weapon inflicts 8-64 hit points.

.*Disintegration Damage*
If the target has a wate less than the amount of matter disintegrated it disappears.
If it is a persona she is irrevocably destroyed and suffers classic disintegration.
Partial disintegration inflicts 1-20 (1d20) hit points in damage per kg destroyed.
For example, a 100 kg target that has 21 kg disintegrated will take 8-64 plus 20-400.
Very few personas survive a disintegration event. 

.*Other Stuff*
The disintegrated matter must be semi-contiguous.
For example, a hit on the backpack, would annihilate the backpack, and send its contents clattering to the floor.
If hit location is important jump to xref:combat:hit_locations.adoc[Hit Location].
If there is trouble deciding if matter is contiguous or not jump to xref:uncombat:sphincter_rolls.adoc[Sphincter Roll]

WARNING: Nomenclature overlap could lead to different methods of disintegration. User must be remain wary.

A weapon malfunction indicates an internal disintegration event.
This will most likely destroy the weapon.
This gun is also known as a vaporizer, a duster and a dismodulator.

The fusion pistol is a vicious weapon.
When fired, it launches a miniscule blob of fusion material.
The first persona damaged by the fusion pistol is the firer.
The heat blast is so intense that the firer takes 3-30 (3d10) hit points of damage.
Firing damage is inflicted every time the weapon is fired.
Self damage can be avoided by turning on fusion pistol shielding.
When the ammo is loaded, shielding can be activated decreasing output to 3 rounds.
A fusion pistol installed in powered armour does not damage the firer.

If firing the fusion pistol seems dangerous being the target is much worse.
The fusion pistol has both direct hit damage and area of effect damage.
A target hit by a fusion pistol has a good chance of simply exploding. 
The exploding target turns into molten fleshy shrapnel.

The grapple gun fires a sticking device attached to a strong cord.
The grapple is the mainstay of most every action movie in existence. 
This weapon offers great opportunities for story progression.

There are two type of grapple guns. 
Destructive and non-destructive.
The player can pick either. 
Otherwise there is a 42% chance the grappled will be destructive.

Both grapples are mechanized and can lift 130kg straight up at 3 h/u.
An unattached grapple can be power rewound in 1 unit of combat time.
An attached grapple can only be removed if there is *no* cord tension.

Grapple guns have a off label use of being used to hit and pull in unwilling targets.
There is no ruleset for land fishing.
A recommended approach would be to first compare wates.
If wates are comparable (medium-sized vs medium-sized) then move to Strength challenges. 
To compare personas competing by attribute jump to xref:uncombat:attribute_rolls.adoc#_attribute_competition[Attribute Competition].

A malfunction with this weapon indicates a mechanism jam.

.*Destructive Grapple*
This is the classic metal barbed grapple. 
The business end appears like a bouquet of alloy barbs.
The destructive grapple must score a hit.
When it smashes into the target 4-24 (4d6) hit points of damage is inflicted.
This could harm a targeted persona or damage a rooftop. 
There is a 5% chance of adherence per point of damage inflicted.
Forcefully removing this grapple will inflict a 1-4  (1d4) hit points of damage.

.*Non-destructive Grapple*
This is the non-destructive sticky grapple.
The business end appears like a cluster of synthetic grapes.
The sticky end does no damage, but it will attach to anything that it hits.
The sticky grapple can only be removed by pushing a button on the gun.

:description: Stubby rifle with satellite dish instead of a barrel.
include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

The gravruptor gun inflicts gravitational anomalies to disrupt and damage.
A hit by the gravruptor subjects the target to a blast of random gravity.
A miss has no effect on the target or surrounding objects.
The gravruptor is ineffective against targets with a wate greater than 500kg.

Most often the gravruptor gun will add 1-4 (1d4) gravities to the local terrain.
The target may crash to the ground, and weapons are torn from grasps.
This pressing problem will also inflict damage to all targets in the area of effect.
This damage is 1 to 12 (1d12) hit points in damage per extra gravity.
E.g., 3 gravities would smash targets into the ground for 3-36 hit points of damage.

Being crushed into the ground, flung into a ceiling or wall, or shot into space, the damage is the same.
It is possible that further damage may follow if the persona flies off a cliff, or lands in a toxic waste pit.

include::hardware:partial$gravruptor_effects.adoc[]

All of the above effects are described for a normal gravity world.
What effects this gun has on high gravity and low gravity planets depends entirely on the ref.

The gravruptor gun is designed for zero gravity combat.
It has no recoil to cause the firer any spin problems, and sends those targets that it hits flying off into space.
A successful attack roll will still inflict damage for accelerating the target, and the target will then fly away at 1 h/u per 2 hit points of damage.
Thus a hit that inflicts 20 hit points of damage would send the target racing off into space at an uncontrolled movement rate of 10 h/u.

The gravruptor gun is also known as an accelerator rifle, or a gravgun.

A malfunction with this weapon will result in a gravitational anomaly attacking the weapon and weapon holder.

The napalm gun sprays a jet of flaming adhesive death.
The jet from the gun is covers a 19 by 1 hex swath area of effect.
The area of effect is a straight line, and cannot be swept over an arc.
Everything caught inside the one hex wide path will take 10-100 HPS of damage.

All objects capable of burning have a chance of bursting into flames.
The percentage chance of immolating is equal to the damage rolled.
If a target were to take 64 hit points in damage, it would have a 64% chance of bursting into flames.
Targets that are set alight will burn for 1 to 10 units.
Each unit of burning will inflict an additional 2 to 20 (2d10) hit points of damage.

This weapon is also labelled the torch, Bick, flame thrower, or a cig weaver.

Usually, a malfunction indicates a mechanism jam, but occasionally it may cause the flame thrower to explode.

=== Needler

Wate:: 0.7kg (100gm)
EXPS:: 300
Value:: 300 (1000)

A needler is a silent pistol that launches bunches of specialized needles.
A hit inflicts 1-6 (1d6) hit points of damage. 
The needles can be coated  in a variety of quick release poisons.
The poisons will only have an effect on organic targets.
The player must make a roll versus poison or be incapacitated.
Regardless of the poison type, the target will be incapacitated.
The intensity of the poison attack is 12 plus 2 per point of damage.
So a hit for 5 hit points of damage would have a poison intensity of 22.

All of the poison types, except pharma, disable the target completely.
Nausea is incapacitating and amnesia is total.

include::hardware:partial$needler_effects.adoc[]

.*Pharma*
Pharma is a special ammo type that injects a pharma into the target. 
In this case, the needler is a long range hypodermic needle.
To determine the med injected jump to xref:hardware:pharma.adoc#_pharma_type[Pharmaceuticals].
If the pharma is beneficial to the persona, they can choose to fail their saving roll.
This way long range healing pharma can still help the persona. 
The value of the pharma is multiplied ten fold in this format.
Powerful pharma are limited to one dose only.
Note that a miss with this weapon has no effect and wastes the pharma.

Each cartridge is a self-contained unit, containing the needles, toxin and power.
A malfunction results in a mechanism jam wasting all remaining rounds.
