// todo must create a base explanation of AR, R, Wate etc. 

Biomech is a specialized form of armour that is servo-aided, computer-enhanced and intimately integrated with the wearer.
Typically biomech armour is sealed, carries its power plant and fully integrates with its accessories.
Biomech armour enhances the wearer's attributes by electronically amplifying the persona's natural abilities.
Biomech armour becomes an anatomical extension of the persona, fully integrating her with the armour and its artifacts.

NOTE: *Biomech was formerly Powered Armour.*

== Suit Fabrication
Every biomech suit is uniquely appointed with it's own accessories.
Kind of like lethal snow flakes.

.*Suit Accessory List*
* Air-conditioned (automatic)
* Armour hardened (automatic)
* 0-3 (1d4-1) additional core accessories

=== Core Accessories
Suit accessories are systems integrated into the entire suit.
These total suit accessories are composed of protective coverings, specialized computers, or unique servo mechanisms.
Some of these abilities are standard for all armour (air conditioning and armour hardening).
There are also some random suit accessories.
Each suit gets 0 to 3 (d4-1) rolls on the Random Suit Accessories Table.

include::hardware:partial$biomech_accessories_core.adoc[]

Air Conditioned::
Every suit comes with air conditioning.
Waltz into lethal mechanized combat within the confines of luxuriously air-conditioned biomech armour.
Air conditioning is more like the life support of a spacecraft than a comfort tool.
Air Con also keeps the wearer from overheating due to the armour's internal heat generation.
Additional air conditioning units layer over each other improving comfort and safety.

Alarm::
The alarm system will alert the wearer of ambush or sneak attacks, especially while sleeping.
The alarm system has an AWE of 30 and a 25 hex radius.
It will alert the wearer to any ambushes that it detects.

Anti-Personnel::
Anti-personnel prevents costly suits of biomech armour from being overwhelmed by hordes of expendable fodder.
The anti-personnel system blasts a two hex radius with an excruciatingly painful dose of electricity, flame, flash, shrapnel, or sound.
Anything holding onto the biomech armour must make a save versus mental attack or let go of the suit.
The anti-personnel system will also inflict 2 to 12 (2d6) hit points of damage to everything within range.
The intensity of the painful repulsion attack is equal to the damage inflicted (2-12).
The wearer can use the anti-personnel defence every other unit of combat.

Compucammo::
Trillions of optical sensors and multi-coloured emitters cover the powered suit and allow for classic sciency fiction situational camouflage.
When in the camouflage mode, the sensors inform the light emitters, via an integrating computer, of the most beneficial shade of camouflage.
In rare cases, compucammo can disguise itself amongst smells or vibrations.
Compucammo assists the wearer in carrying out ambushes and is of no use during combat.
For no practical reason at all, compucammo may change colour to reflect the wearer's mood.

[discrete]
=== Compucammo Charisma Bonus
.CHA + 1-3 (1d3)
****
Wearer CHA =  12 + 1d4 = 12 + 2 = 14
****

Armour Hardened::
Hardening is simply an improvement of the toughness of the suit's alloy-ceramic hull.
Each armour hardening increases the suit's Defence Rating by 1d100.
Armour hardenings are cumulative.

Hover::
Limited antigrav (or rockets) allows the armour to coast down from any height safely.
Hovering is not flying, but it allows for limited control.
The wearer can guide her 200 kilograms plus suit the best landing site.
The persona can use any attack while hovering.

Internal System::
An internalized system is less like an accessory and more like an entirely different roleplaying game.
The internal system takes all the attributes of the biomech armour and surgically inserts them within the persona's body.
The persona externally appears to be like any other persona.
The similarities end as soon as she starts shooting lazers from her fingers and launching grenades from 'where ever.'
Internalizing a suit of biomech armour can only work if the referee permits this within her milieu and story.
Many accessories are not possible when the suit converts from an exoskeleton to an internal system.

Jump::
Biomechanical computers combined with limited antigrav and leg servos allow the wearer to make massive jumps.
The persona's jump distance is five times further than her usual xref:combat:move_in_combat.adoc#_jumping[Jump,window=_blank]. 
The player uses her persona's armour-adjusted STR to calculate the extended jump.
The jumps will take 0 to 3 units to complete, covering the desired distance while flying through the air.
During the jump, the armour wearer will be able to use all weapons and devices at her disposal.

Neural Synched::
With neural synchronization, the suit's servo system links directly to the wearer's cerebellum.
This highly invasive connection allows the wearer to turn skills into automated neural programs.
These neural programs override the wearer's motor control system and turn her complex maneuvers into reflexes.
The preprogrammed skills must be entirely motor in execution.
Skills like hand-to-hand combat would be learnable, but find shelter would not.
The wearer can store one preprogrammed skill per four points of Intelligence.

Radar::
Radar allows for long-range (500 hex radius) sweeps to identify ground terrain and large bodies in motion.
The info appears in a cinematic heads-up display like any good sciency fiction plot enhancing radar.
The wearer can turn the radar on and off.
Radar may also make the persona very detectable. 
Standing within two hexes of active radar is a 1 to 6 intensity radiation attack.

Radiation Hardened::
Densely packed waveform absorbing coatings add protection from radiation exposures.
The radiation hardening doubles the wearer's CON vs killing radiation.
If the player wins a saving roll, the radiation does not affect her persona.
If the suit is radiation-hardened more than once or twice, the wearer's CON will be tripled and quadrupled against radiation attacks.

Biologic Hardened::
Biologic hardening protects the wearer from uncombat environmental conditions.
This hardening protects against toxic, infectious, and extreme environments.
The wearer is unaffected by poison gases and biological attacks.
This hardening does not protect against radiation or exatmo environments.
This biomech armour has a mini airlock that allows small items to transfer into the biomech armour's protective environment.

Zero-G Maneuvers::
Zog maneuver allows the persona to move about as if normal in the wateless three-dimensional terrain of zero gravity.

== Helmet
Helmet accessories are baked-in parts of biomech armour's helmet.
Any guns built into the helmet will fire from it, and communicators will be accessed directly by the persona. 
There are standard equipment (communicators and visual aids) and random accessories for the helmet.

== Suiting Up
Biomech armour should fit into the referee's milieu and story.
The armour may be the pinnacle accomplishment of an institutional medico-military laboratory run by a government or corporation.
The armour may be standard issue general motorized infantry gear.

The persona may have always had the armour on, not remembering life without it.
The biomech armour may be patiently waiting for someone to step into its savage but convenient auto dresser.
The biomech armour may require multiple life-threatening neurosurgical interventions spread over numerous missions.

Undressing biomech armour is a difficult task as well.
The persona is shedding several hundred kilograms of metal, removing direct neural links, and faces a body atrophied by servo dependence.
Some biomech armour accessory prevents the persona from ever wanting to leave their combat cocoon.

When fully powered, the exoskeleton has a restrictiveness of one (unrestricted).
When powered down, the wearer is trapped in a tight-fitting coffin.

== Shapes

=== Aliens
A 6-tonne alien suited in biomech armour would be a formidable opponent indeed.
If the referee is willing to follow this crazy path, she must keep in mind that a campaign could easily be imbalanced by such a powerful opponent or ally.

Alien species that are at the tool use level of creator can have biomech armour.
The shape of the biomech armour would match the shape of the alien inside.
If the alien shape indicates, they may have more than two arms to armour up.
If the alien is gigantic, they may have two flanks and ventral and dorsal body parts.

=== Robots
The biomech armour would be an outer layer of the robot.
All the enhancements that any persona would benefit from would aid the robot as well.
Any robot peripherals or systems have to adapt to an empty accessory point.
A robot may shed its biomech armour layer like any other persona.

=== Anthros
Strangely shaped mutants are extremely unlikely to find biomech armour that fits them.
Mutants are unique anomalies, unlike aliens, which are part of an entire species.

== Combat
Combat is made more complex by biomech armour. 
The player can deploy every combat accessory in every unit of combat. 
The persona that she can fire all her weapons, check her radar, and launch a nuclear device in two seconds.
This multitasking only applies to combat weapons built into the biomech armour. 
Multitasking does not apply to vocation skills, vet equipment, detectors, or specialized comms. 

== Power Source 
Biomech armour will not suddenly run out of power.
There will be lots of indicators and indications that the suit is running low.
Having personas with biomech armour constantly seeking power can be a challenging limitation to the powerful artifact.
Biomech armour has a power plant similar to that of robots.
The Robot Power Plant Table is listed here for convenience.

include::hardware:partial$power_source_types.adoc[]

When the exoskeleton is powered up, there is no noticeable restrictiveness.
When the exoskeleton is powered down, the persona is trapped in a shapely coffin.

== Suit Value
The base value of a suit of biomech armour is 10000000 eps (ten million).
The value increases with the addition of accessories.
Accessory artifacts are worth ten times their typical values (due to defence contract budgeting).
The value of these accessory artifacts increases the value of the biomech armour.
The value of armour-specific accessories also increases the value of the biomech armour.
The value of these accessories is listed below.
