.*This mutation is a defect.* 
This mutation is a defect and hampers the persona who possesses it.
If the player is rolling up a new persona, the player gets to roll an additional mutation along with this defect.
Ideally, a non-defective mutation will accompany each defective mutation.
If the player is unlucky, it is possible to have two, or more, defective mutations accompanying the non-defective mutation. 
Defective mutations can lead to a mutant having an unusual amount of mutations. 

If the persona acquires the defective mutation during gameplay, there is no accompanying non-defective mutation.
Defective mutations that arise from gameplay represent misadventure. They are often the result of malfunctioning pharma or mutagenic toxins.
