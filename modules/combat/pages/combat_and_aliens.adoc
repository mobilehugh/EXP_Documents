. Flora and Fauna rarely have tactics.
. Flora and Fauna see technology as terrain, like sticks and rocks.
. Only tool using aliens use weapons.
.. Weapon using aliens use a vocation attack table.
. Naturally evolved attacks use Skilled Bonus on the attack table
. Aliens do not have Force Bonus for their natural attacks.
.. Aliens do have Force Bonus when they use weapons.
. Only tool using aliens use armour.
.. Alien naked Defence Rating is randomly determined.
.. Descriptive body part types do not affect Defence Rating.
. Alien die at zero hit points.
.. Aliens do not suffer damage system shock and can fight until dead.
