= Spacecraft Combat Tools

These are the details of spacecraft attacks and defences function. 
The actual devices are brought into being when the spacecraft is generated. 
Spacecraft are created in the xref:hardware:spacecraft.adoc[Spacecraft] section.
Players and referees should understand spacecraft before blowing them up.

== Attacks
Attacks are a collection of electronic, kinetic, and energy weapons that one ship uses to control or damage another ship.
Some attacks work as defences as well.

== Attack ECM
*Electronic Counter Measures is Turn Order 1*

ECM is an abbreviation for electronic countermeasures, and it is pronounced "easy em."
ECM is the battle for control over the electromagnetic spectrum.
In spacecraft combat, ECM is the battle for control over the electronics of the target ship.
Attack ECM can confuse the target ship's defences with false data and manipulate the target ship's essential components.
ECM can be used defensively instead.
An ECM is only capable of doing one of each per turn.
The pilot must choose between Attack Assist, Attack Control or Defense each turn.

ECM only applies to the turn it is utilized for. 

.*ECM Choices*
. Attack Assist
. Attack Control
. Defence

=== Attack Assist
When ECM is being used to assist its own ship's attacks, it will attempt to deceive the target by creating inaccurate or false data for the target ship.
ECM does this by making single attacks appear as multiple attacks, altering the apparent course of incoming attacks, or confusing the estimated arrival time of an attack.
All such falsified data will increase the chance of success of a ship's attack.

.*Attack Assist*
* Attack Rolls (physical) +150 per Computer Level
* Success Rolls (electronic) *3% per Computer Level

Consider a spacecraft with a level 2 computer employing ECM Attack Assist.
The player would get +300 on Attack Rolls when attacking with physical elements like missiles, mines and artillery.
When making Success Rolls for electronic or navigational elements like Attack Control or Ramming Attempts the player would a bonus of +6.

=== Attack Control
ECM control manipulates a target ship's onboard systems.
The chance of successfully controlling another ship's systems is 8% per level of the attacking spacecraft's computer.
If an ECM Control Attack should fail, that particular control attack cannot be re-attempted during the combat session.
However, a different ECM Control Attacks are still possible. 
If an attempt to reduce drive effectiveness fails, the ECM Control Attack can attack the ship's gravity in the next turn.
The pilot can choose to use control attacks until something clicks.

If control ECM is successful, the targeted component's capacity decreases.
An ECM unit cannot do anything else while controlling the target ship's components.
This effect will last until the target ship breaks the ECM, the target ship uses its special drives, or the attacking ship ceases the attack.

The referee will often need to improvise the effect of an ECM control attack.
When improvising, the ref should remember that a successful ECM attack will not destroy a ship.
An ECM control attack reduces a particular ship component's effectiveness and increases the ship's vulnerability to other attacks.

=== Defence
ECM goes both ways.
ECM can be used for both attack and defence.
The particulars are divided between the Attacks and Defences sections for organizational reasons. 
To go over all the details of ECM defence jump to <<_defencive_ecm, Defencive ECM>>


=== ECM Success Roll Target

== Ramming
*Ramming is Turn Level 2*

Ramming is a boarding method.
Ramming is similar to boarding, except that ramming has lots of crunching and scraping noises.
Ramming is different from regular boarding because it does not align airlocks.
A space cruiser with a ramming attack has a specialized fortified airlock that can ram into any part of the target ship's hull.
Ramming is violent and throws caution to the solar winds.
Once attached, the invading party may breach the hull to gain entry into the ship.

ECM can assist ramming. 
Using ECM as an attack assist for ramming gives a +6 bonus per computer level on the Ramming Pilot Roll.
ECM cannot assist ramming while carrying out other ECM attacks or defences.

.*Ramming Checklist*
. Determine the number of ram attempts
. Determine Ramming Pilot Roll
. Assess Damage Location on target.
. Extent of Damage to target vessel (max Major)
. Damage (one level less) to ramming vessel
.. Lash and board 0-3 (1d4-1) turns
.. Smash and run

=== Attempts
An attacking vessel only has so many opportunities to ram a target. 
The target ship's pilot and computer make avoidance maneuvers using the exatmo drives.
Eventually, the target vessel will become immune to the ramming attacks.

Maximum number of attempts is 

=== Calculate Attempt Number
.Attempts = (attacker drive + computer + pilot levels) - (defender drive + pilot levels)
****
attempts = 5 (drive 5) + 2 (computer 3) + 1 (pilot 1) - 4 (drive 4) - 2 (pilot 2) = 2 
****

==== Positive Ramming Attempts
If the number of ramming attempts is positive, the attacker gets that many ram attempts.
An attacking vessel cannot have more than four ramming attacks per turn.
If the number of ram attempts is two, the attacker can make two ram attempts during the turn. 
If the number of ram attempts is six, the attack can make four ram attempts during the turn.

==== Zero Ramming Attempts
The ships are at equipoise and the ramming ship gets one ramming attempt that turn.

==== Negative Ramming Attempts
The ramming vessel is inferior to the target vessel and is only allowed one single ramming attempt for the entire battle.
In some cultures this is called a Hale Mary. 
The ramming vessel suffers a penalty equal to the ramming attempts number.
The penalty is not built into the Ramming Success Roll, and cause the ramming vessel to lose pilot and computer levels. 

If the ramming attempt number is -3, the attacker must remove 3 levels from her pilot level.
This can often lead to a success roll >100. 
In this instance the player must roll 100 to successfully ram. 

=== Ramming Success Target
.100 - (12% + pilot level) * computer level
****
success = (12 + 3 (pilot 3)) times 6 (comp 6) = 15 * 6 = 90 +
target = 100 - success = 10. Player must roll 10 or higher to ram.
****

=== Ram Begets Ram
Each time an attacker has a failed ram, the target gets a chance to ram in return.
The target spacecraft gets one ram attempt per failure.
If an attacker fails three ramming attempts, the target ship gets three ram attempts. 

=== Ram Location
Ram location is randomly determined as both ships are writhing at nearly light speed.
The ram location determines where the ram connects.
This location determines vessel damage or boarding location. 
How to determine the location of a successful ram jump to <<_damage_location,Damage Location>>.

== Smash or Lash
The players must decide whether they are smashing and running or lashing onto the rammed vessel.
Smashing is as it sounds.
The attacker smashes the target ship and backs off like a demo derby near light speed.
Lashing involves attaching to the target ship and boarding through the breached hull. 

Ramming damages both the ramming and rammed vessels. 
Hull breach success is automatic and takes 0-3 (1d4-1) combat turns.
The Damage Location Roll also indicates where the attacking ship will breach the hull.
For example, if the damage location is the target ship's drives, the boarding party will enter the vessel at the drives.

== Artillery
The purpose of ship artillery is to damage the target ship so that it ceases to function.
This goal is achieved by penetrating the hull and delivering the artillery's destructive force to the internal components of the ship.

Space vehicle artillery has the same damages and effects as the inatmo artillery it is modelled after.
The two differences are ammunition stores and range. 
Energy-based weapons can fire as long as the ship has fuel, and ammunition requiring ammo will have 100 times the regular supply.
There are no range penalties during spacecraft combat. 

The expedition cannot fire spacecraft artillery from exatmo to inatmo.
This artillery cannot cross into an atmosphere.
Once the spacecraft is inatmo, the players can use the artillery as usual. 

=== Attack Roll
Artillery requires a successful attack roll to inflict damage.
The player must win an attack roll against the target spaceship's Defence Rating.
The attacker must make a kilodie roll higher than her target's Defence Rating.
The target ship's Defence Rating, including hull strength and ECM, may prove impenetrable to many artillery attacks.

The attacking ship's computer level adjusts the artillery's attack roll.
A gunnery program will fire the artillery automatically, with a bonus of +50 per level of ship's computer.
If a skilled gunner persona is firing the artillery, there is a bonus of +100 per level of ship's computer.
The organic firing bonus is due to the unpredictability of an organic life form firing a weapon.

== Boarding
*Boarding is Turn Order 4*

Boarding is congenial ramming.
Boarding lines up airlocks to prepare for a breach and boarding of the target vessel.
The attacker can only use boarding to force airlocks together while exatmo (exterior to atmosphere).
Once connected, the attacking crew will breach the airlock of the target ship and then board.
Boarding is a preferred attack because it preserves the target spacecraft, hostages, cargo and is a lot more fun.

.*Boarding Checklist*
. Determine the number of board attempts
. Make Boarding Pilot Roll.
. Prepare to board

=== Mutual Boarding
If two ships are trying to board each other, they will be automatically successful.
Since the goal of both ships is to connect airlocks.
ECM will recognize that both ships want to connect, and it will happen automatically.
If either the attacker or target vessel wants to direct the mutual boarding to a specific airlock, they must win a boarding roll.

=== Attempts
The number of boarding attempts equals the number of ramming attempts, and the same calculations apply.
Table is included here for convenience.
There is a maximum of 1 attempt at boarding per turn.
If the number of boarding attempts is less than one the vessel *CANNOT* board.

=== Calculate Attempt Number
.Attempts = (attacker drive + computer + pilot levels) - (defender drive + pilot levels)
****
attempts = 5 (drive 5) + 2 (computer 3) + 1 (pilot 1) - 4 (drive 4) - 2 (pilot 2) = 2 
****

=== Boarding Success Target
.100 - (4% + pilot level) * computer level
****
success = (4 + 3 (pilot 3)) times 6 (comp 6) = 7 * 6 = 42 +
target = 100 - success = 58. Player must roll 58 or higher to board.
****

=== Once Connected
If the player wins the boarding roll, the two vessels attach via airlocks.
Once connected to the target ship, there are a few options.
The attacking vessel can stay docked, and the boarding party can work on opening the airlock.
Usually, a boarded ship will be resigned to its fate and open the airlock to avoid damage.

Combat fuel consumption is the only requirement to remain attached.
Once a ship has been boarded, it cannot forcefully detach from its attacker.
The only recourse that the target ship has is to continue maneuvering at combat fuel consumption and hope that the boarding ship runs out of fuel.
If the boarding ship can no longer maintain combat maneuvers, the target ship can break away from boarding. 

If the target is unwelcoming, the airlock may require breaching.
Airlock breaching is left for the referee to run with her players.
Mechanics and spies are more proficient at airlock opening than dumb old mercenaries.

== Grenades
*Grenades are Turn Order 5*

The types of spacecraft grenades are the same as their inatmo counterparts.
The main difference is that these grenades travel by mini-missile or mini-mines, and they must win an attack roll to damage the target.
Inatmo personas throw grenades and only need to get close to damage a target.

The grenade is a spacecraft vs a spacecraft weapon.
A successful attack roll must be made against the spacecraft's Defence Rating to inflict damage.
If the attack roll is unsuccessful, the grenade detonates ineffectively and silently in space.

Grenade delivery systems have diminutive titles because they only deliver grenades. 
Proper missiles and mines deliver bombs.

=== Mini-Missiles
Mini-missiles are rocket-propelled space grenades.
Each mini-missile must win an attack roll to damage their target.
Attack Assist ECM can be used to help the Attack Roll. 
The mini-missile attack lands in same turn as launched.
It is acceptable to have mini-missiles land in the following turn.

*A vessel can launch 2 mini-missiles per computer level per turn* 

Mini-missiles cannot cross an atmosphere.
They must stay exatmo or inatmo.
When used inatmo, the mini-missiles attack like regular grenades as an area of effect weapon.

Targeted vessels can outrun mini-missiles.
The targeted vessel must have a exatmo drive that is two levels higher than the attacking vessels. 
When outrunning mini-missiles the targeted vessel cannot make any physical attacks, boarding or ramming. 

Targeted vessels can use ECM to impair mini-missiles. 
Defensive ECM, or Attack Control ECM can mess up mini-missile targeting and drive power.

=== Mini-Mines
Mini-mines are thruster powered space grenades.
They do not have rockets like mini-missiles and do not chase targets. 
The can make short burns to punt themselves within range of targets.
They can be dumped in the path of a chasing vessel or launched against the hull of ramming vessel.

*A vessel can dump 4 mini-mines per computer level per turn*

Mini-mines, like mini-missiles, cannot survive the rigours of crossing into an atmosphere but can be used to bomb targets once inatmo.

The mini-mines are useful because ECM does not affect them.
Mini-mines also move too slow to be blocked by shields.
Essentially mini-mines cannot be avoided unless they are visually detected.
The ability to detect the tiny camouflaged mini-mines in space requires a bizarre AWE (kilodie) roll.

== Bombs
*Bombs are Turn Order 6*

Space vehicle bombs function the same as their inatmo counterparts, but the delivery is a mine or missile. 
The prefix naval is used to reflect the military nature of these weapons and their vessel destroying purpose.

Bombs need only explode near the ship's hull to inflict damage to the contents within.
A bomb is guaranteed to damage a target with a successful attack roll.
Every bomb gets a second chance to damage a vessel just by getting close enough. 
If the raw roll of a missile or mine is better than 542, the target is still damaged.
Dangerous, destructive weapons.

=== Missile
A missile delivering a bomb is a bespoke weapon for destroying target vessels.
The term naval missile, bomb missile and missile are interchangeable.
Using a missile is about destroying a target vessel.

*A vessel can control 1 missile per 3 computer levels.*

Missiles can target any detectable spacecraft.
No vessel can outrun a missile, but they can buy some time.
This allows for time to impact countdowns and story building.
ECM can impair a missile's ability to function.

=== Time to Impact
.Target's Exatmo Drive Level - Attacker's Exatmo Drive Level
****
impact time = 5 (target drive 5) - 2 (attackers' drive 2) = 3 turns of tension
****

The time to impact is the minimum time to impact. 
The attacking vessel can hold off impact longer than the time to impact if so desired. 
This could be done for negotiation, dramatic, or some other dirty reason.
If the attacker's drive exceeds the target's drive the time to impact can be in the same turn as launch.

NOTE:*time to impact is a wonderful sciency fiction plot device*

An attack roll is still required to damage the target.
However even a miss can still damage the target. 
If the raw roll of the kilodie is higher than 442 the bomb still damages the target.  

Missiles cannot function inatmo.
A target vessel may escape a missile by hiding inatmo or by jumping with the special drives.

=== Mine
A mine delivering a bomb is a bespoke weapon for destroying target vessels.
The term naval mine, bomb mine and mine are interchangeable.
Using a mine is about destroying a target vessel.

Mines have minimal drive capabilities and are meant be dumped into the path of a pursuing vessel, or dropped from space onto planetside targets.

*A vessel can control 1 mine per computer level*

Mines are virtually undetectable.
Defensive ECM does not work against them.
Visually detecting a mine in space is an improbable (d100) Awareness attribute roll.
Mines are hardy enough to be deployed in the atmosphere or in orbit to be used as fierce surface attack weapons.

== Naval Artillery
*Naval Artillery is Turn Order 7*

Naval artillery is a bespoke weapon for destroying target vessels and it's accompanying life forms.
This weapon is not used to soften a target for boarding, or fire warning shots. 
Naval artillery has only one purpose in mind, to destroy the target vessel.

Naval artillery is more deadly than its deadly inatmo companion, inflicting many times more damage and many many times more range.
One use of naval artillery exhausts a whole day's worth of fuel.
For dramatic effect naval artillery can only be fired once a turn. 
Players cannot idly use their naval artillery; it requires a gunnery program and gunners.
Without this complement, a ship cannot fire its naval artillery.

The player must win an attack roll to damage the target.
However a miss with naval artillery may still inflict damage on the target vessel.
A successful attack roll is considered a direct hit and inflicts *two* damage rolls on the target.
A near miss still does one damage roll on the target. 
A near miss is a raw attack roll greater than 442.

Shields can only absorb damage from one damage roll in the case of a direct hit. 

Naval artillery only works exatmo and cannot cross or be used in the atmosphere.
Keeping in mind that a vessel cannot escape into the atmosphere in time to avoid this attack.

== Defences
A spacecraft's defences both defend against attacks and the hostile environment of outer space.
Defences are a mix of combat defences and essential exatmo life support protections.

.*Defences*
. Life Support
. Gravity Control
. Hull
. Armour
. ECM
. Shields
. Guns
. Actives

== Life Support
Life support maintains a comfortable environment for the organic and delicate inorganic contents of the ship.
Life support is a fancy air conditioner that also supplies the air.
The life support, gravity control and the ship's hull have an intimate level of integration. 
Life support is impossible to disable because it is both distributed and self-contained.
The ship's computer depends on an intact life support system.
Life support functions correctly unless directly damaged by combat.

ECM Control Attacks can manipulate life support and make the inhabitants uncomfortable.
Control ECM cannot turn off life support or threaten the well-being of the ship's contents.

include::combat:partial$life_support_onion.adoc[]

Destroying life support is rarely the goal of spacecraft combat. 
Spacecraft are too valuable to destroy utterly.
A loss of life support destroys all life on the ship, and more importantly, the ship's computer.
Life support has onion layer protection, and the outer layers protect the inner layers. 
One cannot damage life support without disabling the hull and then gravity control first.

A partially damaged life support system will maintain a fraction of the atmosphere proportional to its amount of damage.
A fully operational life support system taking major damage would only have 60% of the previously had atmosphere.
This thin atmosphere will make it more challenging to work and stay conscious.

If a spacecraft loses all layers of life support at once, the ship will suffer explosive decompression.
Decompression destroys all organic materials (personas) and delicate inorganic devices (computers, robots, toys).

== Gravity Control
The gravity system is a crucial component of the life support system.
The gravity control, life support and the ship's hull have an intimate level of integration. 

include::combat:partial$life_support_onion.adoc[]

Gravity control maintains gravity at a constant attraction of 1g.
The gravity is uniform across walkways, workspaces, cargo holds, cabins, and hull exterior.
The ship's computer can adjust the gravity from 0.5 to 1.5 gravities.

Gravity control maintains a comfortable working gravity throughout the ship at all times. 
Personas onboard will not notice any difference between a stationary ship and one making combat maneuvers near light speed.
Almost any maneuver performed by a spacecraft would destroy all organic materials (personas) and destroy all delicate inorganic devices (computers, robots, toys) without gravity.

NOTE: *Gravity control is a sciency fiction mechanism designed for role-playing fun.*

The gravity system can be manipulated by control attack ECM.
However, control ECM cannot turn off gravity or make life dangerous for the vessel's contents.
ECM Control Attacks are an irritation manipulating the gravity to confound, not kill, the crew.

.*Damage to Gravity System*
. Gravity at <30% No combat
. Gravity at <10% No exatmo or inatmo movement 
. Gravity at <1% No gravity
. Life Support vulnerable

At less than 30% function, gravity control cannot maintain safety during combat maneuvers.
Without the protection of gravity control, the vessel must drop out of combat.
Loss of gravity control is a victory condition.

At less than 10% function, gravity control cannot maintain safety during standard exatmo drive maneuvers.
Without the protection of gravity control, the vessel must crawl through space with limited acceleration.

== Hull
The hull is a crucial component of the life support system.
The ship's hull, gravity control and life support have an intimate level of integration. 

include::combat:partial$life_support_onion.adoc[]

The hull is the containment and physical defence system of the ship.
The hull also defends against both hostile environments and attacks.
The star cruiser's hull is the last line of defence.

The hull supplies the spacecraft's Defence Rating used in combat.
The hull and Defence Rating have an intimate relationship.
In combat, the hull absorbs damage decreasing Defence Rating.

NOTE: *The Hull Defence Rating (DEF) protects the Hull. Once the Hull DEF is is less than 420, the Hull takes direct damage rolls.*

Defensive ECM can increase the spacecraft's AR against attack rolls.
The increase in AR is a transient electronic deception and does not alter the Hull DEF.

== Defencive ECM
Electronic countermeasures (ECM) deceptively manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum to defend the ship.
ECM is more effective as the ship's computer level increases.
If any personas have skill in ECM, they can add that skill level to the computer level used for the ECM.
So if a mechanic has ECM level 2 and the computer level is 3, then the ECM will function as a level 5.

ECM is an accessory unit of the ship's computer. 
Electronic countermeasures are both attack ECM and defence ECM.
An ECM unit cannot be both at the same time.
If the spacecraft has only 1 ECM unit, the players must decide how to use it each combat turn.

ECM can be used to attack or defend. 
For more info about attack ECM jump to <<_attack_ecm,Attack ECM>>

=== AR Boost
Most often, defensive ECM will be used to make the ship harder to attack.
ECM creates false images of velocity, trajectory, rotation, size, etc.
All of this electronic tom-foolery results in a +200 bonus to the ship's Defence Rating per computer level.

=== Break Control
Defensive ECM is essential when the ship is under attack from control ECM.
Defensive ECM can identify whether a ship's component is malfunctioning or whether it is malfunctioning due to control ECM.
Defensive ECM will use the ship's computer to re-route communications channels and alter security, to defend against ECM Control Attacks.

For example, if a control ECM attack had reduced the effectiveness of the ship's drives, defensive ECM could be used to break this control.
Successfully breaking this control restores the drives to their previous level.
The chance of success is 15% per computer level.

==== Break Control Success Roll Target
.100 - 15 * (computer + skill level)
****
success = 15 times (comp 3 + engineer 2) = 75 +
target = 100 - success = 100 - 75 = 25  Player must roll 25 or higher to break control.
****

=== ECM Camouflage
Defensive ECM can be used to hide the ship electromagnetically.
ECM will make the ship blend in with the background or appear some anomaly other than a spaceship.
This aspect of ECM will not hide the ship from a visual inspection, but it will deceive another ship's sensors.

==== ECM Camouflage Roll Target
.success = 100 - 9 * (computer + skill level)
****
success = 9 times (comp 3 + engineer 2) = 45 +
target = 100 - success = 100 - 45 = 55  Player must roll 55 or higher to break control.
****

=== Damaged ECM
Damaged ECM drops its effectiveness by the percentage indicated on the Extent of Damage table.
For example, ECM at 50% efficiency can only offer +100 per computer level to the ship's Defence Rating.

== Shields
The shields protect the hull AR and hull from energy and kinetic attacks.
A defensive shield may be a force field or a structural mechanism. 
Both mechanisms work by distributing the destructive force across the entire hull.
This faux scientific diffusion effectively dampers the damage.
The shields have an active mode that the players turn on to thwart intentional damage.
Shields also have a passive mode, and when present, they are part of the life support system.

Shields require energy to distribute attack damage and are powered directly by the exatmo drives.
The shields can absorb 100 HPS of damage for every level of exatmo drive.
For example, a ship with a level 4 drive could absorb 400 HPS of damage.
An attack with 429 HPS of damage against a 400 HPS shield would only deliver 29 HPS damage to the ship.

The shields absorb damage from mini-missiles, naval-missiles, artillery, and naval artillery attacks.
Shields do not affect ECM, boarding, ramming, mini-mines or naval mines. 

Active shield use doubles fuel consumption. 
Shields usage is optional.
Players may choose to turn off their shields to conserve fuel.

Passive shielding becomes part of the life support system.
Damage must disable the shields before the Hull DEF can be damaged.
This passive protection does not use any extra fuel.

include::combat:partial$life_support_onion.adoc[]

== Guns
A gun is a purely defensive element in spacecraft combat.
A gun does not sound like a defensive tool, but occasionally the best defence is a good offence.
Guns on spacecraft are anti-personnel air lock defence weapons.
In ship-to-ship combat, a gun is an ineffectual weapon.
However, to prevent boarding or airlock intrusion, a mounted gun can be very effective.

.*Airlock Defensive Guns*
* operate inside or outside of the airlock
* operate inatmo or exatmo
* operates autonomously with software
* Can be controlled by personas
** mercenaries do this best
* has unlimited ammo to defend against boarding
** ammo can be limited to forward plot
* has an AR equal to the ship's hull
** including ECM and shields
* damaged by Hull DEF damage or airlock damage location

== Active Defenses
Active defences intercept incoming attacks.
Active defences are sometimes called actives.
They can eject micro-missiles, shrapnel, energy blasts, lazer matrices, or crystalline discharges. 
The goal is to dissipate, prematurely detonate, or destroy incoming attacks.
All active defences function equally.
Active defences can stop grenades, bombs, or artillery.
Actives defences cannot stop boarding, ramming, ECM, or naval artillery.

.*Active Defence Types
* micro-missiles
* shrapnel clouds
* ceramic bullets
* crystalline discharges
* lazer matrices
* energy hoses
* phalanx

[discrete]
=== Active Defence Success Roll Target
.success = 100 - 9 * (computer + exatmo drive + skill levels)
****
success = 9 times (comp 5 + drive 3 + skill 0) = 72
target = 100 - success = 100 - 72 = 28 Player must beat 28 to actively defend. 
****

A ship can attempt to thwart one attack per level of computer per turn.

.*Notes about active defences*
* Active defences are not part of the Life Support Onion
* Active defences are automated
** Gunnery skilled personas can help
* Active defences work inatmo and exatmo
* *Actives cannot be weaponized*

== Counter Attacks
Counter attacks are not defences per se, but they do offer defencive capacity to a vessel.
Counters are specific defences against specific attacks. 
For example, a ship being rammed or boarded gets to counterattack with mines or artillery. 
Counters are detailed on the the Attack Defend Counter Attack Table.
Said table is repeated here for convenience.
