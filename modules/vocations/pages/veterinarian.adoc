Veterinarians are the healers of the organic world.
Vets are a combination of doctor, homeopath, surgeon, paramedic, and faith-healer.
They can utilize whatever odds and ends available to assist organic personas in need.
Vets are self-trained and have *not* suffered at a college or school.
They learned from oral histories, experimentation, pamphlets or bits of AV material. 
Their work may be temporary or permanent, incompetent or miraculous.

== Conduct
Veterinarians need the trust of their patients to function.
The therapeutic relationship depends on Charisma, trust and skill.
This vocation does not have an oath by any means, but proper conduct makes them better veterinarians.

.*Good Person Good Veterinarian*
* Avoid using weapons that kill or damage life.
* Avoid using violence as a solution unless last resort.
* Make the best choices for their patients

The more the vet strays from these suggested tenets, the harder it will be to heal personas.
It is also possible that a guild or club may take issue with a violent vet.
This conduct is a general goal.
The persona need not be a pacifist or sacrifice their lives senselessly.

== Vet Abilities
Vet abilities are particular aptitudes that a vet can accomplish and other vocations cannot.
They are divided into approaches (gifts), interests and skills.

=== Approaches
Approaches (gifts) are the inherent talents that define the persona as a veterinarian.
The player does not have to roll to succeed with an approach.
An approach happens immediately unless combat time is activated.

=== Interests
The interests of a veterinarian indicate broad areas of knowledge, skill or comprehension.
Veterinarian interests are divided into diagnosis, treatment and research. 
An interest in diagnosis will help with any task roll that involves figuring out what is wrong with a persona.
Treatment interest helps the player win task rolls that alter (hopefully for the better) the wellness of a persona.
An interest in research assists the persona when enhancing or inventing procedures and devices related to healing.

At startup the player gets 1 roll on the interest table per 4 points of Charisma.
At each additional experience level the player can roll or choose a new interest.

include::vocations:partial$veterinarian_interests.adoc[]

=== Skills
The veterinarian skills are abilities that are focused onto one area of knowledge or procedure. 
The skills are quite specific and fall under one of the three interests described above.

The player makes one roll on the skill table per interest generated. 
A new skill is acquired at each new experience level.

==== Diagnostic
Figuring out what is wrong with an organic persona.
The task may entirely involve figuring out what is malfunctioning.
If what is wrong is obvious a diagnosis task can be attempted to assist the treatment task. 

include::vocations:partial$veterinarian_skills_diagnostics.adoc[]

==== Treatment 
Treatment skills are abilities that repair or cure or temporize an ailing persona. 
Diagnosis is figuring out what is wrong treatment is fixing it. 

include::vocations:partial$veterinarian_skills_treatment.adoc[]

==== Research
Research is anything outside the realm of treatment and diagnosis.
Research skills include enhancements, cybernetics, new pharma, or new previously unknown processes.

== Specific Skills

Quick Fix::
This ability allows the vet to repair injured personas quickly.
Quick fixes give the patient persona an HPS boost. 
They are most commonly quickly carried out during combat.
The difficulty and during of a quick fix depends on the amount of healing desired.

Subliminal Suggestion::
A veterinarian can pop words into the minds of unsuspecting targets.
The vet can force simple commands such as don't jump, drop it, or stop on the target.
The more reasonable that the suggestion is, the more likely that the subliminal suggestion will succeed.
There is no saving roll for the target if the player wins the task roll.
The degree of difficulty depends on the target's Mind.
If the target has a 9 MND, the DD of the maneuver is 9.

Paralyzing Pinch::
The vet can render the target unconscious using a dramatic pinch technique.
Willing patients do not require the vet to make an attack roll.
In an unwilling patient, the player must first win an attack roll.
The vet must apply the pinch for 0-2 units (1d3-1), and each unit indicates the player must win another attack roll. 
Only after the successful attack rolls is the task roll made.
A failed task roll leaves the target enjoying a harmless shoulder grip.
There is no saving roll for the target if the player wins the task roll.
The degree of difficulty depends on the target's Constitution.
If the target has a 9 CON, the DD of the maneuver is 9.

Death Pinch::
Death Pinch is the deadly version of the paralyzing pinch.
There are no voluntary receivers of this attack.
The vet must apply the pinch for 0-2 units (1d3-1), and each unit indicates the player must win another attack roll. 
Only after the successful attack rolls is the task roll made.
A failed task roll leaves the target enjoying a harmless shoulder grip.
The target gets a saving throw versus poison.
The degree of difficulty depends on the target's Constitution.
If the target has a 9 CON, the DD of the maneuver is 18.

== Task Examples
Vet maneuvers involve the healing, repair and enhancement of organic life forms.
Vet maneuvers can be considered Gut or Knowledge maneuvers.
The referee can adjust task Roll bonuses depending on where the maneuver lies.

The vet must be able to smile at her patient.
Personal connection is essential equipment for successful veterinarian maneuvers.
The referee may make a target roll more difficult if the vet cannot emotionally connect with her patient.

== Experience
The benefits of increasing experience levels are more skills, improved task roll bonus, and not much else. 
Veterinarians earn experience points for completing maneuvers and role-playing within their vocation.
Only 10% of combat experience can go towards a vet's experience point total.
