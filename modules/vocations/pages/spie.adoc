Spies are masters of deception, infiltration and targeted violence.
Spies can employ any combination of these abilities to satisfy their goals.
The spie is a tough, mean, and ruthless vocation; however, a spie is not a psychopath by nature. 
There is no moral code for spies, and they can be on the side of good, evil or both.
It is hard to distinguish the bad from the not-so-bad in the realm of violent espionage.

Spies are an excellent source of dangerous assignments (from governments, corporations, societies or private citizens).
Spies are not dependent on a commission and may carry out a little extortion or kidnapping for their own profit (or fun).
Spies are often members of secret guilds or naughty lodges dedicated to the clandestine arts.
How deeply involved the expedition gets with a spie's source depends on the milieu of the campaign.

For campaigns using vocation attribute requirements:
Total of the following attributes--AWE, CHA, CON, DEX, INT, MND and STR--must meet or beat 92.

== Knowledge
Spie knowledge is broken down into interests, expertise and martial arts. 
Interests are broad areas of interest.
For example, an interest in infiltration would help the player making an infiltration related task rolls.
The interest of incapacitation will assist whenever the spie is trying to incapacitate a target.
Expertise represents a deeper and narrower area of knowledge. 

== Interests
Interests are broad areas of knowledge in which the spie has aptitude.
The interests are infiltration, deception and destruction.
Any task that the persona pursues that involves sneaking would benefit from the infiltration interest.
The destruction interest supports any task that involves weapons or an unwilling increase in entropy.

At startup, the player makes 1 roll on the interests table per three points of INT. 
After startup, the persona gets to roll, or choose, one new interest per EXPS level. 

include::vocations:partial$spie_interests.adoc[]

== Expertise
Spie expertise are narrow areas of knowledge that assist the persona when making a task roll.
Expertise is narrower than an interest and is less likely to apply to a task.
However, when an expertise does apply is helps the task roll more than an interest does.
Personas get one expertise per interest at startup. 
After startup, personas may choose, or roll, for another expertise each EXPS level. 

=== Infiltration
Expertise in getting into places where one should not be. 
This expertise does not involve face-to-face deception, but the deception of architecture and security systems.
The player makes one roll for each infiltration interest. 

include::vocations:partial$spie_expert_infiltration.adoc[]

=== Deception
This area of expertise is for face-to-face trickery, shenanigans, and manipulations. 

include::vocations:partial$spie_expert_deception.adoc[]

=== Destruction
Expertise in combat and mayhem.
The spie can gain expertise with weapons or field techniques.

include::vocations:partial$spie_expert_destruction.adoc[]

== Martial Arts
Spies have their own style of fancy hand-to-hand combat.
The martial art includes kicks, punches, bites, chops, head-butts, and body slams.
The martial arts ability is for unarmoured hand-to-hand combat only.
Martial arts attacks do not use weapons and are effective only against targets in an adjacent hex.

include::vocations:partial$spie_martial_arts.adoc[]

Attack Bonus::
When using martial arts the player uses the Strike - Skilled portion of the attack table. 
It is presumed the persona is proficient in their martial arts attacks. 
Martial arts attacks *do not use Force bonus* on damage. 

Attack Order::
The attack order is the secret sauce of spie martial arts.
The attack order allows experienced spies to make an attack roll before and during their opponentsâ€™ attacks.
The attack order supersedes initiative.

.*Martial Arts Attack Order*
* Before - attack roll before opponent attack regardless of initiative
* During - attack roll during opponent attack regardless of initiative
* Normal - normal initiative and attack roll timing.

If two spies have tied martial arts attacks (for example, both have Before), use initiative between the spies. 

Attack Damage::
An attack roll win delivers the listed damage.
The player does not use the Force bonus when using martial arts.

Defence Bonus::
A spie's Defence Rating (DEF) increases through dodges, parries, blocks, and rolls.
This martial arts DEF is for an *unarmoured* dress such as a tuxedo or bathing suit.
This Defence Rating bonus does not improve the AR of worn armour.

== Tricks
Spie tricks (gifts) are tasks the player does not need to make a task roll for.
The persona gets one knack at first level and more difficult ones are added at prescribed levels.

== Experience
The benefits of increasing experience levels are more tricks, improved task results, and improved combat expertise. 
Spies earn experience points for completing tasks and role-playing within their vocation. 
Only 75% of combat experience can go towards a spie's experience point total.

include::vocations:partial$spie_exps.adoc[]

== Tasks
Spie tasks are about deception, treachery and sneaky violence.

Spies have essential equipment.
A spie must have some element of deception in their persona equipment.
Deceptive equipment includes a pair of dark sunglasses, a fake ID or a trench coat.
The referee may make a target roll more difficult if the spie has no tools of deception.
