The spie is a tough, mean, and ruthless vocation.
Spies are highly skilled in unarmed combat, deception, and assassination.
Spies can employ any combination of these abilities to satisfy their goals.
A spie is not a psychopath by nature. 
There is no moral code for spies, and they can be on the side of good, evil or both.
It is hard to distinguish the bad from the not-so-bad in the realm of violent espionage.

Spies are an excellent source of dangerous assignments (from governments, corporations, societies or private citizens).
Spies are not dependent on a commission and may carry out a little extortion or kidnapping for their profit (or fun).
Spies are often members of secret guilds or naughty lodges dedicated to the clandestine arts.
How deeply involved the expedition gets with a spie's source depends on the ref's milieu or scenario set up.


== Spie Abilities
Spies have a collection of tricks (gifts), interests and skills. 
Spie tricks are baked in abilities of a spie persona. 
The spie gets new tricks with new levels.
Interests are broad areas of interest.
For example, an interest in infiltration would help the player making and infiltration related task rolls.
The interest of incapacitation will assist whenever the spie is trying to incapacitate a target.
Skills are much more specific and indicate either a focus of knowledge or a maneuver. 

=== Tricks
The spie tricks (gifts) are those abilities that help define the persona as a spie. 
No other vocation has access to these abilities.
Spie tricks are baked in and not trained. 
The spie gets tricks at 1st, 4th and 7th level.

== Specific Skills
Limitations and expectations of various spie tasks. 

Assassination::
Assassination allows the spie to instantly and irrevocably kill a target with a single attack.
Under certain conditions, with the correct weaponry, a spie may carry out an assassination.
There are lots of required conditions for an assassination.
Assassination requires knowledge of the target's anatomy.
Whether a spie can assassinate robots and aliens is up to the referee. 

.*Assassination Checklist*
. Win an ambush
. Win an attack roll
. Win a task results roll
. Using an appropriate weapon

If the player fulfills these four requirements, the target is irrevocably dead.
Medical science cannot medically repair the victim.

The spie must have complete surprise through a successful ambush.
For more information about surprise jump to xref:combat:ambush.adoc[Ambush,window=_blank].
An assassination cannot happen during combat or when the target is in a hyper-aware state.

There will be attack roll bonuses with a successful ambush. 
The player must win an attack roll before making the assassination task results roll.

The spie must be using a controllable weapon like a sword, pistol or rifle. 
Area of effect weapons, flame throwers and fusion weapons lack the precise control assassinate at target.
It is not about the damage the weapon delivers but its stealth.
If the task results roll is successful, the player does not even roll damage, and the target is dead.

The degree of difficulty for the task results roll is equal to the target's Awareness attribute score.
The referee can alter the DD as she sees fit.
Plot points and player personas are highly resistant to the assassination ability.

If the player fails the task results roll, the weapon still inflicts damage on the target.
If the damage kills the target, it is not considered an assassination by the spie.
A target that dies during a failed assassination attempt could still be resuscitated.

Only a failed task results roll will reveal the spie's position in a long-range attack.

.*Incapacitate vs Assassinate*
There is a variation on this ability where the spie incapacitates the target by wounding.
There is no difference in the DD of the maneuver, but the player must roll damage.
If the damage does not accidentally kill the target, then the spie has successfully incapacitated the target.

Disguise::
Spies are naturally adept at not appearing as themselves.
A spie can alter the appearance of her hite and wate with no effort at all.
A spie can make herself appear 50% taller or 25% shorter.
A spie can make herself appear 50% heavier or 25% skinnier.
These changes in hite and wate do not require a task results roll.

More elaborate the disguise, the more difficult the task results roll.
The ability to detect a disguise depends on the Awareness attribute of the observer.
Anthros cannot disguise themselves as aliens or robots. 
Vice versa applies. 

.*Impersonation DD*
* Stranger 1-6 (1d6) DD
* Coworker 1-12 (1d12) DD
* Friend 2-25 (1d12 + 1/2AWE) DD
* Family member 2-37 (1d12 + AWE) DD
* Intimate partner 3-62 (1d12 + 2*AWE) DD

The player may be required to make this task results roll multiple times. 
A failed task results roll for disguise reveals the disguise but not the spie.

Attack Order::
The attack order is the secret sauce of the spie's martial arts.
