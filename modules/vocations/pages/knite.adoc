The Knite vocation is a mix of mysticism, militarism and morality.
Knites are mythic and take a clear stand supporting Order or Chaos. 
They are the only vocation with a strict code of conduct.

The Knite vocation combats foes in the Physical Space and the Think Space simultaneously.
They use their Strength and Mind simultaneously.

Every Knite vocation is psionically active.
They have no adverse disposition towards using technology, but the Knite vocation feels most comfortable wielding their traditional energy sword.

The mental powers of the Knite vocation use Kirlian energy. 
EXP includes Sciency Fiction details about how all this works in its generic mythos.
The referee should understand xref:appendices:generic_mythos.adoc#_the_spaces[The Spaces,window=_blank] and xref:appendices:generic_mythos.adoc#_kirlian_energy[Kirlian Energy,window=_blank] and how these impact the Knite vocation.

If the campaign is using attribute requirements for vocations a Knite must have a Mind of at least 18.
Most campaigns will have some sort of trial process before ascension into Order or Chaos.

== Orders
The Knite vocation has two mutually opposing groups.
Both sides manipulate Kirlian energy to fulfill their goals.
Order and chaos are the competing sides of this binary paradigm.
On the side of order is the Knite.
They prefer a steady-state and respect life.
On the side of chaos is the Anti-Knite.
They prefer entropy and do not respect life.
Where one finds Knites, there will be Anti-Knites and vice versa.

=== Knites
Knites are the supporters of compassion, goodwill, honesty, and life.
Knites do battle against injustice, intolerance, and enslavement.
They will err on the side of good at every opportunity.
Knites are not pacifists and will deliver fatal justice without a second thought.

Knites tend to go off on "damn fool quests."
Knites do not ignore injustices perpetrated by their fellow expedition members.
A Knite is a powerful ally in combat but may hinder an expedition's nefarious objectives.

Kirlian energy arises from the interface between the Think Space and the Physical Space. 
The Knite's strong sense of order makes them potent conductors of the Think Space.
This amplification of the Think Space allows them to sense and manipulate the Kirlian energy around them.

=== Anti-Knites
Anti-Knites are the enemies of goodwill, humanity, and organized civilization.
Anti-Knites are anti-everything.
An Anti-Knite is devoted to spreading chaos and entropy, but this does not make them random nihilists.
They can be systematic, calculating, and patient.
A complicated plan that leads to more chaos is good.

Anti-Knites tend to organize "complicated deceptions."  
Anti-Knites have no regard for personas less powerful than them.
The moment fellow expedition members are no longer valuable to the Anti-Knite, they can expect a savage betrayal.

WARNING: Anti-Knite personas will result in tragedy and strain player relationships. 

Kirlian energy arises from the interface between the Think Space and the Physical Space. 
The Anti-Knite's strong propensity for chaos makes them potent disruptors of the Physical Space.
This disordering of the Physical Space allows them to sense and manipulate the Kirlian energy around them.

== Practice
In short, Knites must behave, and Anti-Knites must misbehave.
Neither order has a rigid codex of conduct, and no persona is perfect.
There will always be minor mis-steps by Knites and Anti-Knites.
Severe or persistent transgressions may get the persona into trouble.
The consequences for mixing up Chaos and Order will depend on the nature of the transgression.

The persona may temporarily lose her ability to use Kirlian energy, and therefore lose her Knite abilities. 
A powerful Knite of the same side may appear to remind her of her duties.
A powerful Knite of the opposing side may appear and attempt to turn her.

=== Ascension
The Knite vocation is powerful and complex.
One does not 'just become' a Knite.

.*Process*
. Permission from Referee and Table
. Attribute requirement of Mind 18, or higher
.. Kirlian powers stop if MND < 18
. Ascension Trial


==== Permission
The Knite/Anti-Knite paradigm requires extra attention from the referee and must fit into her milieu.
The referee will have to create a mythos if the EXP generic mythos does not fit her milieu.
It is also recommended that the player table be okay with the possibility of an Anti-Knite in their midst.

==== Attribute
The Mind attribute requirement for the Knite vocation is sacrosanct.
The persona loses her Knite vocation abilities if her Mind score drops below 18.

==== Ascension Trial
It is fine to skip the ascension plot for a Knite persona.
Don't let rules get in the way of the story, or the fun.
However, the ascension of a Knite is very fun, and very storyful. 

The Knite is a vocation.
It may or may not involve training. 
It may or may not involve religion.
The ascension trial activates the persona's latent Kirlian connections, and awakens the vocation.
During this trial period, the player's actions determine which side her Knite persona will follow.
The righteous will likely become Knites and the ruthless Anti-Knites.
The trial can be an elaborate plotful multi-session mini campaign where Knites and Anti-Knites are influencing the persona.
The trial can be as simple as helping a geriatric equine across a busy space walk. 
Upon completion of the trial the persona will realize she has ascended to the codified slavery of the Kirlian energy.

Most Knites will function as Nothings without any of the pulls, money or privilege of the Nothing vocation. 
The future Knite persona can have a vocation if they desire.
Once they ascend they will eschew all abilities and benefits of that vocation. 
It is possible that a persona can increase through several vocation levels before ascending into Knite-dom.

=== Turning
Turning is when a Knite moves from order to chaos, or vice versa.
Knites trying to convert Anti-Knites to order, and Anti-Knites trying to corrupt Knites is a fun plot driver.
However, the EXP mythos has some strong limits on this process.
The referee is free to alter turning to her milieu, but flip flopping Knites defeats the purpose of the vocation.

A Knite devoted to order can be turned to the side of chaos.
If a Knite is having a vulnerable time, the forces of chaos may conspire to create a complicated plan to turn her.
Anti-Knites seem always to be prowling around in the dark, waiting for Knites to falter.
Once a Knite becomes an Anti-Knite, there is no turning back.

An Anti-Knite devoted to chaos cannot be turned in the physical space.
Only in death can an Anti-Knite be turned.
If an Anti-Knite shows weakness (kindness), the forces of chaos may conspire to create a complicated plan to destroy her.
If an Antiâ€‘Knite carries out a heroic act of kindness, she can become a Knite in martyrdom.

=== Energy Sword
The Knite's unique weapon is her energy sword.
The energy sword can be a force field sword, lazer sword, or lite sabre.
The Knite can do certain things with her energy sword that no other persona can.
These abilities only work with her bespoke energy sword.
The Knite cannot pick up any glowing weapon and do Knite sword tricks.

=== Death
Death is quite final in EXP. 
There are very few ways to restore a dead persona.
In the case of a Knite, nothing can revive them.
When a Knite dies, her Kirlian connection breaks, and she is permanently dead.
Death of a Knite has different implications depending on whether the Knite is with order or chaos.

A Knite's strong sense of order is a powerful conductor of the Think Space. 
This ordered connection to the Think Space allows them a translucent presence after death.
Dead Knites may occasionally re-appear as translucent immaterial entities to living Knites.

Anti-Knites' strong sense of chaos is a potent disruptor of the Physical Space.
This chaos powers their Kirlian energy in the Physical Space, but leads to their complete dissolution at death. 
Dead Anti-Knites swirl in chaotic entropy and make no smarmy translucent appearances.

== Knowledge
Knite knowledge is split between the physical, mental and society.
Respectively these are referred to as the physicum, cerebrum and culturum.
As will all vocation knowledge a mix of interests and expertise influences the success of tasks. 
In most cases Knite and Anti-Knite knowledge is the same, but their application and goals are different.
There are a few elements of knowledge that are limited to chaos or order. 

NOTE: Knites *cannot* manipulate Kirlian auras through inorganic media like monitors, cameras, or phones.

== Interests
Knites have broad areas of interest that improve their chance of succeeding at task rolls.
One Knite may have a keen interest in manipulating the physical space.
While another Knite may be interested in studying society.
An interest in the Think Space would assist with any task that involves the think space.

At startup, the persona gets one interest per three points of Intelligence score.
A persona with a 12 INT would get four rolls on the Knite Interest Table. 
After startup, the persona earns another interest with each new experience level.

include::vocations:partial$knite_interests.adoc[]

=== Physicum
An interest in the physical space will assist the persona in any task that involves the physical space.
For example, telekinesis involves manipulating the physical space.

=== Cerebrum
An interest in the think space will assist the persona in any task that involves the think space.
For example, intimidation involves manipulating the think space.

=== Culturum
An interest in the cultural space will assist the persona in any task that involves interacting with populations.
For example, interacting with a military institution would be assisted by a culturum interest.

== Expertise
Expertise represents increased knowledge focused on narrower tasks.
Expertise increases the chances of success when attempting a task roll. 

At startup, the player gets one expertise per interest. 
So a Knite with physicum interest 2 and culturum interest 1 would get 2 rolls on the Physicum Expertise Table and 1 roll on the Culturum Expertise Table.
After startup the persona gets one new expertise per new experience level. 

=== Physicum
Physicum expertise represents knowledge and training that supports tasks which impact the physical space.
This can be expertise in areas like energy sword tasks or telekinesis.

include::vocations:partial$knite_expert_physicum.adoc[]

=== Cerebrum
Cerebrum expertise represents knowledge and training that supports tasks which impact the think space.
This can be expertise in areas like reading Kirlian auras or applying psionic pressure.

include::vocations:partial$knite_expert_cerebrum.adoc[]

=== Culturum
Culturum expertise represents knowledge and training that supports tasks which impact the cultural and political space.
This can be expertise in areas like quickly understanding a religion or finding one's way in a political system.

include::vocations:partial$knite_expert_culturum.adoc[]

== Gifts
Knites are the only vocation that calls their gifts, gifts. 
These gifts are powered by manipulating pervasive Kirlian energy with their mind.
Gifts are tasks that a Knite can call on without having to win a task roll.
A gift is like a task that a persona can simply use. 
Knite gifts are conveniences and are not meant to destroy plot.

include::vocations:partial$knite_gifts.adoc[]

== Organizing
Knite knowledge is cumulative and benefits from organization.

== Experience
The benefits of increasing experience levels are more refined interpretations and manipulations of Kirlian energy and improved combat tasks.
Knites earn experience points for completing tasks and role-playing within their vocation.
Knites earn 100% of combat experience.

include::vocations:partial$knite_exps.adoc[]

== Tasks
Tasks are things that the persona does. 
The player uses her persona's knowledge to improve the chance of completing a task.
