The nothing is the non-vocation vocation.
The nothing is the unskilled civilian of the role-playing world.
Most player personas become nothings because they lack any other vocation attributes. 
There are no requirements to follow the nothing vocation besides being alive.
A player can choose the nothing vocation for her persona.

NOTE: Nothings can have a <<_vocation_aspiration,vocation aspiration>>, allowing them to follow a vocation eventually.


== Core Elements
Other vocations have keen areas of interest that assist the expedition's survival.
The nothing vocation is mainly concerned about material goods and their social standing.
A nothing career has no measurable value to the expedition.

=== Social Standing
The nothing's most important attribute is her social standing (SOC).
In many cases she will be comparing her social standing to that of other nothings.
These challenge rolls could used to get to the front of a line or get a larger portion of gruel.

Most personas rolled their social standing (SOC) when generating attributes.
A nothing's social standing is the root of her self-worth.
The higher their social standing, the more influential the nothing is.
For the nothing vocation, social standing is synonymous with wealth and power.
Other vocations may understand social standing's value but have little or no interest in it.
For more information about SOC, jump to xref:attributes:social_standing.adoc[social standing,window=_blank].

A persona can improve her social standing by increasing her EXPS levels.
A nothing adds 1-100 (1d100) to her social standing for each new EXPS level.

=== Pulling Privilege
A nothing persona has one main ability, and it allows her to get her way whether she deserves it or not.
A nothing can apply social pressure on another nothing to get her way.
Pulling privilege involves using connections, wealth or career power to get their way.
The nothing persona with the higher social standing wins.
The mechanics of this can vary with the milieu and the story.

Pulling privilege does not work on personas with vocations. 
Nothings can only use this ability on other nothings for inconsequential outcomes.
Examples of pulling privilege are using SOC to: get sports ball tickets, jump the queue, university admission, or hairstylist appointment.

=== Net Worth
Nothings also have a monetary net worth that is calculated completely differently from other vocations.
Personas in other vocations are more focused on their vocation than their remuneration. 
Nothings are the opposite of this.
They measure their self worth by their net worth.
The nothing's net worth is calculated at startup after all abilities are generated. 

==== Calculation
Personas in the nothing vocation start with a lump of material value.
This wealth is never an artifact or useful device.
The source of wealth is usually limited to the persona's home.
The nothing persona's wealth will be items like property, furniture, bonds, bank accounts, or piles of coconuts. 
Ultimately, the wealth's description depends on the referee's milieu.

The persona's social standing attribute guides the value of her wealth.
Her social standing indicates the number of wealth rolls and the wealth rolls' value.
A campaign could easily revolve around a nothing persona with spectacular wealth and connections.

The treasure system is complicated and convoluted.
The player does not need to know the treasure type.
The player only uses the two tables below to determine her persona's net worth.
If you want more information about treasure jump over to  xref:hardware:treasure.adoc[Treasure,window=_blank].

NOTE: A nothing cannot get an artifact when calculating net worth.

== Nothing Abilities
Nothing abilities generally don't help the expedition out during combat or research.
However, the nothing abilities can get the expedition access to funding or connections to help reach their goals.
The nothing vocation has pulls (gifts), interests and skills. 
All of these focus on the nothing moving ahead in their culture. 

=== Pulls 
These are the gifts that allow the nothing function in her home setting.
Pulls have little or no impact on the expedition's lofty goals, but certainly can help.
Pulls are not chosen by the player and are granted to the persona as she acquires nothing EXPS levels.

include::vocations:partial$nothing_pulls.adoc[]

=== Interests
A nothing has three interests: career, homes, and privilege.
Career interest will assist the player with any task rolls she makes related to her persona's career.
The homes interest strengthens any tasks the nothing is trying to complete in regards to her home bases.
The privilege interest assist the persona with any task where she is getting her way through connections and not merit.

include::vocations:partial$nothing_interests.adoc[]

=== Skills 
Nothing skills are very diverse, some are like biomes, others are careers, and yet others are obnoxious tasks.
The skills will assist the nothing in any task where the player can apply the chosen interests or skills.

==== Career Skills
A nothing's career is not a vocation.
The persona's career may be something that they talk about a lot, but it has no value to expedition survival.
It will be a rare circumstance when a nothing can use her career to aid the expedition.

A nothing can pursue greatness in her nothing career.
However, her social standing solely determines her career success and nothing else.
A nothing may aim to become the best chef in the city, an accountant, or the fastest cage cleaner.

include::vocations:partial$nothing_skills_career.adoc[]

==== Home Skills
Nothings are not from nowhere.
The nothing home is like a cultural biome.
A home is where the persona's social standing and wealth have the most influence.
A nothing vocation can have multiple homes.

The persona adds a new home at every new EXPS Level.
The player can choose to extend an existing home or randomly generate a new one.
If a persona gains an EXPS level in a foreign home, she automatically adds it to her home list.

==== Privilege Skills
These are specific actions that nothings can undertake to forward their privilege and meritless advancement.

== Task Examples
Nothing tasks are about surviving in the social fabric of wealth, fame and luxury.
Nothing tasks do not really exist, as they offer nothing of worth to the expedition.
If the expedition convinces the referee that a nothing maneuver is possible it will be a Gut maneuver.

The essential equipment for a nothing is any useless item of arbitrary value.
This could be a some cash, a credit card or a vacation souvenir.
The referee may make a target roll more difficult if the nothing has nothing.

== Experience
Nothings gain experience points by earning money.
Nothings only get 10% of combat experience.  
Nothings are the only vocation that earns EXPS from money.
A nothing earns 1 EXPS for every 100 eps made.
Earned money is monies collected from life-threatening exploration.
Earned does not include gifts, stipends, grants, awards, or risk-free salaries.

=== Career Nothing

=== Nothing EXPS for EPS
.1 EXPS per 100 eps
****
A nothing who earns 1k adds 10 EXPS to her EXPS Total.
****

The persona only gains nothing EXPS levels if the player has chosen this as her persona's sole vocation.
If the player has chosen to pursue nothing as her persona's vocation, she increases EXPS levels as she earns experience. 
Each new EXPS level increases the persona's SOC and adds a new home.

The persona does *not* use these EXPS levels if she has a vocation aspiration.

include::vocations:partial$nothing_exps.adoc[]

=== Vocation Aspiration
A nothing can pursue a full-fledged vocation if the player desires.
The player can declare her nothing persona to have a vocation aspiration at any time.
However, it is best to make a vocation aspiration clear when the persona is created.

Instead of using EXPS to gain experience levels, the player pools her  EXPS to pursue her preferred vocation.
The nothing persona vocation aspiration allows a player to pursue a vocation even if her persona lacks the attributes.
Vocation aspiration cannot bypass the attribute requirements for the knite vocation.

NOTE: a persona with  vocation aspiration present while earning pooled EXPS. 

A nothing persona aspiring to become a mercenary must collect 18001 EXPS to become a mercenary persona.
Once she has earned those 18042 EXPS, she becomes a first level mercenary.
The persona leaves the nothing vocation behind and becomes a full-fledged mercenary with 0 EXPS.
