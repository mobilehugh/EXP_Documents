The robot persona's wate allowance depends on both her Prime STR and her Strength attribute. 
Wate allowance is one area where robots have an advantage over organic personas with the same attribute score.

A robot with a 3 Prime STR and a 17 STR score has a wate allowance of 75 kgs.
Beyond 75 kgs of equipment, the robot will suffer movement penalties like all other personas.
