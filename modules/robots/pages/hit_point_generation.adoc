= Hit Point Generation

Each robot type has hit points listed on its fabrication info sheet. 
The player calculates her robot persona's hit points max when the robot type is determined. 
The player multiplies the robot's Constitution score by the hit points listed on the fabrication info sheet.
An explorations robot (E) with a 20 CON could have between 220 and 320 hit points max.
A datalyzer (D) with a 4 CON could have between 4 and 12 hit points max.
The robot world is entirely unfair.
