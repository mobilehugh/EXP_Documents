= Policing

Policing robots are crime-fighting machines.
These robots respect the lives and livelihoods (if legal) of all life forms.
They are exceptionally protective of their fabricator type.
Policing robots can be stationed anywhere.
They are not limited to underserviced or violent areas.

Civilian policing robots are constables on patrol in a drum.
Civils can walk the beat, chase criminals, guard banks, issue tickets, etc.
By sheer chance, this robot's ID is P-C. 
This robot is the primary interface between the 'people' and law enforcement.
Civilian policing robots have some special skills.

=== Commanding Voice
When necessary, the civil robot can unleash booming amplified voice commands.
Classic commands like FREEZE! or DROP IT! can be used.
At the very least, the commanding voice is distracting to organic ears.
Referee personas with low Mind may stop in their tracks when hearing the commanding voice.
Player personas are unaffected by commanding voice.

=== Non-Lethal Weapon
A non-lethal weapon is one that can disable or affect a target without harming it.
A stun weapon, a sleep beam, or a nausea attack would be considered non-lethal.
Less lethal weapons do not count.
The player has three chances to roll a non-lethal weapon for her robot. 
If there is no non-lethal weapon after three rolls, the persona has no weapon.

=== Disarm
A civil robot can disarm a target with a successful attack roll.

=== Grapple
When it is time to 'collar' a suspect or subdue a target, the civil policing robot can grapple.
An attack roll win will completely immobilize an organic target.
A civil robot is completely invested during a grapple and cannot do anything else.
To break from this grapple requires a successful bizarre STR roll.
Civil robots will unglamorously drag their grappled collars back to the nearest brig.

Riot robots are big crowd control operatives.
They often turn up at labour disputes, surprise sales, food line-ups, rock concerts, etc.
Their goal is to contain and restrain unruly hordes of anthros.
They function as a mobile jail with crowd suppression.

=== Grapple and Detain
Grapple and detain is a two-step process that the riobot employs to apprehend rioters.
To grapple a target, the player must win an attack roll.e
The target gets one attempt to break free from the grapple.
If the target is unsuccessful, she is detained.
Once detained, it is nearly impossible for a captive to break free.
Detained protestors are subject to any area of effect weapons that the riobot deploys.

The riobot can grapple one rioter per unit. 
The riobot can carry out all other operations while grappling a rioter. 
A riobot can detain one target per point of STR.
So a Riobot with a 20 STR can detain 20 targets.

.*Grapple Detain Checklist*
. Grapple target: the player must win an attack roll.
. Break grapple: the target must win a STR challenge
. Break detention: the target must win a bizarre STR challenge

=== Crowd Control Peripherals
These peripherals are attachments designed for crowd control.
They are not malfunctioning peripherals. 
They are bespoke riobot peripherals.
These peripherals are non-lethal immobilization attacks, but accidents happen. 

Riot Policing robot Peripheral for every three points of Intelligence.
A riobot with a 12 Intelligence score would get four rolls on the Crowd Suppression Peripheral Table.
Multiple rolls of the same peripheral are intentional riobot redundancy.
The riobot can use every peripheral every unit of combat.
Multi-tasking is a crucial feature of crowd control.

include::robots:partial$peripherals_riobot.adoc[]

Water Cannon::
A powerful jet of water shoots at a target, and an attack roll win knocks the target down. 
The water cannon's range is one hex per point of Strength.

Tear Gas::
A noxious gas causes severe tearing of organic eyeballs.
The area of effect range is one hex per point of Constitution.
All targets in the area of effect must win a save vs the riobot's Constitution or be blind for 1-4 (1d4) units.

Stun Ray::
A technomagical beam of energy shoots at a target, an attack roll win could incapacitate the target.
The target must win a saving roll versus the riobot's Constitution or be stunned for 1-10 (1d10) units.

Grav Disruptor::
A wave of gravity disruption causes rioters to fall to the ground.
The area of effect range is one hex per point of Constitution.
All targets in the area of effect must win a save vs the riobot's Constitution or tumble to the ground.

Force Beam::
A technomagical beam of energy shoots at a target, an attack roll win throws the target backwards.
The target will land 1-4 (1d4) hexes backwards and cannot move or act that unit.

Weapon Malfunction::
When activated, all weapons within range of the riobot are 50 times more likely to malfunction.
For some weapons, this is extremely dangerous. 
The range of weapon malfunction is one hex per point of the riobot's Charisma score.

Battery Drain::
When activated, all batteries in the area of effect must win a saving roll versus the riobot's Intelligence score or drain.
The battery drain defence does not destroy batteries.
The range of battery drain is one hex for every two points of the riobot's Intelligence score.

Sleep Beam::
The sleep beam is a not so gentle "nighty night meat bag" attack.
The target must win a save versus the riobot's Charisma or sleep until woken.
Someone must intentionally wake the sleeping targetâ€”otherwise, Ms. Sleepy-pants will miss the riot.

A detective policing robot is a criminologist in a drum.
A detective can operate as a chief, manager, auditor, or technologist.
The detective does not grapple with or detain methods. 
A detective directs civil robots to make arrests and do the dirty work.
Detective policing robots focus on the apprehension of criminals.
If an expedition engages in criminal activities, the detective may need to make CF checks.
