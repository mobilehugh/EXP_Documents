Datalyzers are tin-can thinkers stuffed with a sciency fiction technomagical mix of organic and inorganic parts. 
At the core of this thinking machine is a semi-organic, electronically enhanced central computing unit.
They are full of complex algorithms and tend to be emotional.
A datalyzer can even have a psionic mutation.
The chance of having a psionic mutation is the same as its fabricator type plus its Intelligence score.
The psionic mutation cannot be a defect. 
The datalyzer has a Mind of zero, like all other robots.
The robot's Intelligence score replaces Mind when required.
Datalyzers used to be called analog monitors.
