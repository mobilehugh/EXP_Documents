= Robot Size

The robot has a general descriptor of its size called a size category.
The size descriptor determines the Hite and Wate of the robot.
The robot size categories are Tiny, Small, Medium, Large and Gigantic.
The majority of player persona robots will be either Small, Medium or Large.
These robot sizes are human relatable. 

== Size
Robot size is determined by its series or model type.
A expendable combot is medium sized, and a hobbot is small or tiny sized.
Usually the qualitative size description is enough for players. 

There are two additional robot sizes not available to player personas.
These are Nano and Giga. 
They only appear for referee personas.

== Wate
The Wate of a robot is the combination of mass and weight.
The player records her robot wate in kilograms.
A 100kg robot has the same wate as a 100kg anthro and the same wate as 100kg of feathers.

Wate is critical to robots as it determines how much damage is when ramming.
Ramming is the only universal robotic attack.

== Hite
The Hite of the robot is a combination of volume and height.
The player records her robot hite in centimetres.
In most cases, the value of hite will determine how high the robot can reach and what may fit on her chassis.

NOTE: Hite or volume does not alter robot wate. 

If necessary, the player may roll all three dimensions for her robot, calculating the volume occupied by the persona.
The player rolls for height, width and length.
These rolls do not affect the wate of the robot.
The player can arrange the dimensions in whatever order works best for the persona.
If the robot dimensions are ruining a finely tuned player persona, choose story and fun over rules and rolls.

=== Reach
The reach of a robot is how far away from it's torso can it impact the world.
The reach of an anthro is easily understood by referees and players alike. 
However the reach of a robot with a cow shaped body and octopus arms may not be as clear.
Once extremes of size are added into the size "reach" can become complicated indeed.

Typically the robot's arms will be it's reaching limbs. 
If a robot has no arms reaching may not be part of their existence or they can use their legs. 
Reach only applies to grabbing objects or strike attacks. 
Reach does not apply to fling attacks, shoot attacks or psionic evolutations.

Small and Tiny robot reach is limited to the hex that they are in.
Medium and large robots can reach into the adjacent hex.
Gigantic robots can reach through the adjacent hex and into the next hex over.

== if you need to know
Wate to Size estimates is based on the following. 

. 1 tonne of computer equipment occupies 3.5 cubic meters
. 3.5 cubic meters is 1.2 x 1.2 x 2.4 meters of volume
. very roughly 1 tonne of computer is 1 hex of Hite
