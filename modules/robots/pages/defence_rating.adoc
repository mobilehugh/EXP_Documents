= Robot Defence Rating

The robot's Defence Rating indicates how difficult it is to damage in combat.
It is important to note that Defence Rating values are the same for robots and all other personas.
A robot has no immunity from intentional damage because of its metallic composition.
A successful attack roll will damage a robot as it would to any other target.
While an Defence Rating of 700 is equal across organic and inorganic personas, how damage affects robots is entirely different.
