= Exploration

Exploration robots map, search, explore, catalogue, and record.
The robot may be using the data directly or transferring the data elsewhere.
There are two types of exploration robots: planetary and extraplanetary.
Exploration robots often go by the nickname exobots.

Planetary exploration robots work within the atmosphere of a planet.
They are used to find minerals, observe terrain, record weather and take photographs.
A planetary exobot lacks the protections needed to survive harsh atmospheres.

.Planetary Exobot Programmes
* Atmospheric Analysis
* Long Range Communication
* Mineral Identification
* Photography (includes infra-red, x-ray, etc.)
* Poison / Radiation Detection
* Sample Collection

Planetary exobots are mostly interested in the planet, not its inhabitants.
This exobot is more likely to avoid encounters with indigenous species. 
Planetary exploration robots rarely interpret the data they collect.
The data could be sent to a command center, orbiting spacecraft or an extraplanetary exobot.

Extraplanetary exploration robots explore new and unknown worlds.
This exobot has a high level of autonomy and collects data independently. 
The exobot can act on the data it collects or store it for download later. 
The extraplanetary explorer has all her planetary colleagues' programmes and some task-specific ones.
This robot can interpret the information collected by planetary exobots.
The extraplanetary can embrace and contact indigenous life forms. 
Exatmo hardening allows this robot to function in air, liquid or vacuum.


.Extraplanetary Exobot Programmes
* Comprehend languages
* Identify Intelligence
* Map terrain
* Exatmo hardened
