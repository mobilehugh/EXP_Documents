= Combot

Combot is a contraction of combat and robot.
This robot type is responsible for fulfilling the murderous needs of its fabricators. 
There is no mistaking that a combot's role is to destroy life and break things.
This goal does not mean a combot is without rules of engagement or war rules.
A combot should not be an indiscriminate destroyer of everything.

Combots should not be mecha sized city killers that destroy the game balance.
Combots are supposed to be smaller sized drones that fit into a playable human scale.
However, a combot can still be a campaign disrupting killing machine.

Combots are broken robots that are no longer under the direction of a commander or corporation.
This lack of clear direction can make combots more disturbed than other robots.
The more powerful the combot, the more likely a powerful owner is looking to control it.
Combots often have a prehistory of being pursued by established groups in a campaign or milieu.

Defensive combots defend positions from enemy attack.
They are naturally protective of geographical spaces and fellow personas.

Not surprisingly, defensive combots have many defensive systems.
A defensive combot with a 20 Constitution would get five defensive systems.
That is a lot of defences. 
All defensive combots have the following peripherals and programming baked in.

=== Demoralize
Demoralize is a programme that allows the robot to create short-range psychological discomforts.
The defensive combot can create irritating noises or utter vile comments and insults about the enemy.
This programming's in-game effect is unclear but mostly adds a colourful element to combat.
The defensive combot's Charisma score determines how effective her demoralizing actions are.

=== Fortify
Analyze attacking enemy formations to optimize defensive strategies.
Fortify programming can also determine if there is no organized attack pattern.
The success of fortify programming depends on the combot's Intelligence score.

=== Intruder Detection
Intruder detection makes it very difficult for anything to sneak into the detection perimeter.
The range of the detection perimeter is ten hexes per point of Awareness.
The success of detecting a perimeter violation is also dependent on the combot's Awareness score.

=== Anti-Anti-Detection System
Another ability included within the given range is the robots Anti-anti-detection system.
The anti-anti-detection system detects technological stealth devices within the intruder detection perimeter.
This system alerts the defensive combot to the presence of such devices, but the location of the anti-detection technology is not automatic.  
The effectiveness of the anti-anti-detection system depends on the combot's Awareness score.

=== Weapon Identification
A defensive combot can identify any weapon type that damages her. 
The success of weapon identification programming depends on the combot's Intelligence score.
