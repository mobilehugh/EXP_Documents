= Veterinarian

Veterinarian robots are healers in a drum.
They are also called medibots or vets.
This robot type values life and well being beyond all.
It is very difficult for a player to get their vet robot persona to cause harm.
This dedication to life is not limited to their fabricator type but all organic life.

There are two kinds of vet robots: diagnostic and interventional.
Diagnostic vet robots figure out what ails the organic creature.
Interventional vet robots repair, modify or enhance organic flesh.

There is often a tendency for interventional robots to be used for nefarious purposes.
Harming an organic persona would go against all their programming and require a control factor roll.

The forte of the diagnostic robot is diagnosis.
Diagnosis is attributing a patient's condition to an exact pathology.
The diagnostic robot can accurately diagnose all but the most peculiar conditions.
This robot is more interested in diagnosing than anything else. 
The diagnostic robot will only do the tests and scans necessary to diagnose.
This robot does not like to intervene in the patient at all.
Diagnostic robots do not perform surgery or do therapies. 
Many diagnostic robots feel that doing 'procedures' is beneath their station.

The diagnostic robot performs like a veterinarian in all areas except surgery.
The diagnostic robot gets more bonuses and skills than a typical vet.
A diagnostic vet robot gets a task roll bonus of twice her Intelligence score.

The diagnostic robot gets many more skills than the typical veterinarian.
When fabricating her robot, the player gets one roll on the veterinarian skill table per point of Intelligence score. 
The diagnostic vet robot can still get interventional vet skills. 
They just will not be used for interventions.

Interventional medibots are capable of performing all manner of interventions.
Interventional robots perform surgeries. 
They primarily perform sciency fiction surgeries. 
Interventionals can cut, sew, suck, remove, attach, remodel or improve organic flesh.

They will do best when working under the guidance of a diagnostics robot or a veterinarian.
However, interventional robots seem prideful and petulant when given such direction.

Interventional robots have local and general anesthetic skills.
None of the procedures carried out will cause pain. 
The patient will be kept anesthetized for as long as necessary or desired.

The interventional robot performs like a veterinarian in all areas except diagnosis.
The interventional robot gets more bonuses and skills than a typical vet.
An interventional vet robot gets a task roll bonus of twice her Dexterity score.

The interventional robot gets many more skills than the typical veterinarian.
When fabricating her robot, the player gets one roll on the veterinarian skill table per point of Intelligence score. 
The interventional robot can still get diagnostic vet skills.
