= Industrial

Industrial robots have an industry focus.
This robot type is one of the more focused in its functions.
The industrial robot has three sub-types: builder, lifter and mover. 
Their titles explain their functional focus.

Builder robots are mobile assembly machines.
A builder robot is usually not part of the design process.
Designing usually requires input from a mechanic.
Once programmed, the builder robot gets right to it.
The builder will source supplies and create widgets until she runs out of stores. 
It can take a long time to acquire construction materials in austere environments.
Builders with a 22 INT score can design objects (cups, balls, combs, toys).
Programming a builder robot is a Mechanic maneuver.
The more valuable the item, the higher the Degree of Difficulty.
The builder robot cannot replicate fancy high-tech weaponry or other such goodies.
A builder robot should offer a massive bonus to mechanics that are building things.

Lifting robots are former cargo hoists from warehouses or department stores.
Lifting robots are capable of supporting one object per three points of DEX.
So a lifting robot with a 12 DEX would have four articulations for lifting.
The objects lifted by one arm cannot exceed three times the robots Weight Allowance.
If the robot has multiple lifters, they can coordinate to lift a heavier single object.
The robot can lift objects to a height five times her Hite.

If something does not want "a lift," the lifting must win an attack roll. 
A robot can make one attack roll per lift articulation.
This grab is not a damaging attack. 
Lifting robots will spend a lot of time grabbing and damaging targets by dropping them.

The fabricator did not make lifting robots to drop things.
A previous owner may have fired the malfunctioning lifting robot for dropping things. 
The player must win a xref:robots:control_factor.adoc[Control Factor,window=_blank] roll to drop an object successfully.

Dropping things leads to them falling.

Mover robots can easily be mistaken for intelligent trucks.  
A mover robot can carry ten times their robotic wate allowance.
Moving robots get a bonus of 50% on their movement rate.
This robot can read maps and understand even the worst directions.
Mover robots can remember ten waypoints per INT score. 
An industrial mover robot can always find its 'way' between waypoints. 
Waypoints do not work from planet to planet.

Moving robots are self-loading. 
The robot can lift an object twice its wate allowance when loading.
The robot cannot weaponize her lifting articulation.
A mover robot cannot force an unwilling target into its cargo hold.
Lifter and mover robots can make a great team.
