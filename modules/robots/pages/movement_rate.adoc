= Robot Movement Rate

The robot's Dexterity attribute determines a robot's movement rate.
Robots are twice as fast as anthros with the same Dexterity score.
The player looks up the robot's movement rate on the below table.

include::robots:partial$movement_rate_and_dexterity.adoc[]

A robot with a 10 DEX would move at 8 hexes per unit. 
A robot with a 17 DEX would move at 14 hexes per unit. 
A robot that moves faster than ten h/u may be subject to acceleration rules. 

== Acceleration
Acceleration is an optional rule for robots that move incredibly fast.
A robot that moves faster than ten h/u may be subject to these rules. 
Robotic acceleration is one hex per unit per STR prime (1 to 4).

A robot with a movement rate of 16 h/u and a 3 STR  prime would move 10 h/u in the first unit, 13 h/u in the second unit and 16 h/u in the third unit.

These cumbersome acceleration rules should only be applied in rare instances when the players have decided that picayune detail is of utmost importance.
Depending on the locomotion type, robots are affected by terrain just as regular personas are.
