= Wate Allowance

A persona with high physical strength can lift heavier things and carry more stuff.
The amount of equipment that a persona can carry is called her wate allowance. 
The higher an anthro's physical strength, the higher her wate allowance.
How much equipment a persona is carrying determines her encumbrance. 

A persona wearing just her clothes will likely be unencumbered.
A persona carrying too much stuff will find herself encumbered.
Picky referees may limit a persona's equipment list to the nearest milligram.
For the excruciating details of what can be carried jump to xref:i-roll_playing_rules:CH18_Encumbrance.adoc[Encumbrance,window=_blank].

The players should know their persona's wate allowances to ensure they don't 'accidentally' end up carting 3 tonnes of equipment across a  rickety suspension bridge.
