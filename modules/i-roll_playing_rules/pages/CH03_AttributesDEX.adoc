Dexterity represents the connection between the brain and the outside world.
Agility, balance, eye-hand, reflexes and running speed are components of Dexterity.
A person with a high DEX would run faster, dance better and have quicker reflexes.
Dexterity would help the persona catch a priceless vase or dive through a closing door.

Anthro Dexterity is composed of neurons, reflexes, and cerebellar processing.
Robot Dexterity is composed of wiring, servos, processors and the like.
Alien Dexterity is composed of the alien equivalents of neurons and reflexes.

Dexterity determines a persona's amour rating and movement rate.
Each persona family has it's own way of calculating movement and armour rating. 

If a persona's Dexterity falls below one, she is irrevocably dead due to complete motor-nervous system failure.
