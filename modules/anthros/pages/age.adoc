= Anthro Age

Each anthro genus has it's own starting age.
The number of years starting personas have varies wildly from anthro type to anthro type. 
Regardless of the difference in years, most anthros start out in the young adult category.
The starting age of an ursidae is 9 to 12 (8 + 1d4) years old.
The starting age of a florian is 21-40 (20 + 1d20) years.
Both are young adults, regardless of their years.
