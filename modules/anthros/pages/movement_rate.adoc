= Anthro Movement Rate

Movement rate indicates how fast an anthro can move.
In the tactical combat rules, the movement rate represents the number of spaces (hexagons) the persona can move each unit.
The measure of the movement rate is in hexes per unit (h/u).

The persona's Dexterity determines her movement rate.
