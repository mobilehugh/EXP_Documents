= Anthro Genera 

The anthro family has several genera to choose from. 
These used to be called anthro types.
As with all of the families the genera are largely phenotypical, meaning they reflect form more than function.

=== Attribute Minimums
The required attributes for an ursidae are DEX 4, INT 4, and STR 12.  
See above for details ad nauseam.

=== Attribute Adjustments
These are the adjustments made to the persona's attributes.
Strong personas get even stronger, and weak personas may get even weaker.

She would also enjoy a Constitution bonus of +1 and a Strength bonus of +2.
These attribute adjustments make the ursidae strong, hardy, but not too smart
An anthro type attribute penalty cannot drop an attribute below the type attribute minimum.
These attribute adjustments are important because attributes influence a persona's choice of vocation.
The player records the adjusted attributes on the persona record sheet.

Not all anthro types have a choice between larger and smaller sizes. 
These are the "one size fits all" anthro size.
Gender does not determine the anthro size in EXP.
Anthro size a player's choice.
