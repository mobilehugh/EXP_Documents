= Wate Allowance

A persona with high Strength can lift heavier things and carry more stuff.
The amount of equipment that a persona can carry is called her wate allowance. 
The higher an anthro's Strength, the higher her wate allowance.
How much equipment a persona is carrying determines her encumbrance. 

A persona wearing just her clothes will likely be unencumbered.
A persona carrying too much stuff will find herself encumbered.
Picky referees may limit a persona's equipment list to the nearest milligram.

The players should know their persona's wate allowances to ensure they don't 'accidentally' end up carting 3 tonnes of equipment across a  rickety suspension bridge.
