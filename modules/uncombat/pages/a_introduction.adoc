If it is not part of tactical combat it is located here.
UnCombat rules are a collection of rules that guide the referee and players through.
This does not mean that these rules do not have an impact on combat. 
This does not mean that these rules cannot have deadly consequences for personas.

Some of the sections help make decisions.
Some of the sections give perspective and support the generic mythos.
Uncombat rules cannot overcome plot, and should not kill off precious personas.

NOTE: Don't let rules get in the way of the story or fun.
