Driving involves the manual control of any inatmo vehicle.
An inatmo vehicle is any vehicle that is not a spacecraft.
The central assumption is that a persona controls the vehicle as the vehicle's driver.
This section is not for autonomous vehicles or vehicles driven by transportation robots.  
This section is for the tactical driving of vehicles from xref:hardware:vehicles.adoc[Vehicles,window=_blank].

The basic assumption made about driving is that it is safe.
This section applies to the aggressive and dangerous driving of cars, tractors, boats, planes or skateboards.
Drivers that obey traffic regulations and employ reasonable amounts of common sense will be fine.
The driving system only comes into play when personas speed, engage in combat or make reckless choices. 
Under normal circumstances, a vehicle allows an expedition to get from A to C to advance the story.

== Collisions?
Vehicular mishaps should be rare.
The control check is the first step in losing control of a vehicle.
Losing control can result in a collision that injures or kills passengers.
Only under extreme circumstances will a control check be warranted.
For the most part, the vehicle and driver will carry on without issue.
When to make a control check is usually the referee's decision.

.*Control Check Required*
* injury to the driver
** getting attacked by a weapon or hot beverage
* sudden dangerous change in road conditions
** oil slick, chicken swarm
* driver is distracted
** arguing, telling jokes, or juggling dice
* wilfully attempting a hazardous maneuver
** drifting, high-speed turn, barrel roll

.*Collision Checklist*
. Driving Roll (vehicle-based)
. Rally Roll (driver-based)
. Control Loss
. Collision Check

== Driving Roll 
The driving roll is a xref:uncombat:task_rolls.adoc[Task Roll,window=_blank] where the player must beat a target on 1d100 or lose control of her vehicle.
The driving roll functions like other task rolls in that it compares a skill level to a degree of difficulty to determine a target roll.
The player must roll higher than the target roll or lost control of her vehicle.

.*Steps to Driving Roll*
. <<_competency,Determine Driving Competency>>
. <<_difficulty,Determine Difficulty>>
. <<_determine_target_roll,Determine Target Roll>>
. <<_roll_1d100,Make the Roll>>

=== Competency
The driving skill score is a combination of the vehicle's handling level and the persona's driving skill.
Every inatmo vehicle created has a handling level.
If a persona has no driving skill, the skill score is entirely dependent on the vehicle's handling level.
A persona's Dexterity has no role in driving skill score.
The driver's Dexterity comes into play if they need to regain control of their vehicle.

==== Calculate Driving Competency
.Competency = Vehicle Handling Level + Driver Skills
****
Handling level 5 and driving skill 2 gives a driving competency of 7.
****

=== Difficulty
Like all task rolls, the more difficult the task, the more difficult it is to succeed.
The degree of difficulty (DD) is maneuver-specific for driving. 
The base degree of difficulty increases with increasing speed.

==== Speed Penalty
Speed effects are dependent on the persona's Dexterity.
High Dexterity reflects good eye-hand coordination, agility, and reaction time, all of which aids in avoiding accidents.
The maximum speed that a persona can handle is one h/u per point of DEX.

==== Speed Penalty
.Speed penalty  (DD) = (speed  h/u - Dexterity) / 10
****
Driving at 20 h/u with 10 DEX is a +1 DD penalty. +
Having a bonus for slow driving is up to the referee.
****

A persona with a DEX of 10 can travel at ten h/u (36 km/h) without a speed penalty.
For every ten h/u (36 km/h) over this driver's maximum speed, any maneuver increases by 1DD.
A  persona with a 10 DEX is cruising at 40 h/u (144 km/h) has a speed penalty of +3DD.
Even trying to drive straight can be dangerous at high speeds.

=== Maneuvers

include::uncombat:partial$driving_maneuvers.adoc[]

=== Target Roll
The target roll can be calculated or tabulated. 
The table is included here for quick target roll checks. 
The tables below are connected copies from the section on task tables. 

The target roll can be tabulated or calculated.
A tabulated target roll employs a table comparing the degree of difficulty to skill score. 
A calculated target roll employs simple maths to determine the target roll.
Very high skill scores and very high DDs require calculation.

=== Make the Roll
If the player rolls the target number or higher, they have won the driving roll.
A successful driving roll indicates the driver has maintained control and exits the collision checklist.
No one in the vehicles notices anything at all.
If the player fails the driving roll, something has gone wrong, and the persona must rally the vehicle.
The vehicle and passengers are one step closer to a collision, and the player now has to win a rally roll.
Tension mounts.

== Rally Roll
*Failed Driving Roll*

If a player fails her driving roll, all is not lost.
The driver has a chance to recover from her driving error through Dexterity and skill.
The rally roll is a modified attribute roll using the persona's Dexterity and driving skills.
The degree of difficulty is the same DD from the driving roll.
So a persona is unlikely to rally from a mishap at very high speeds. 
The Difficulty of the rally roll can also use the following table. 

include::uncombat:partial$task_difficulty.adoc[]

A successful rally roll indicates the driver has regained control and exits the collision checklist.
A rally roll represents actions that are obvious to everyone in the vehicle.
There may be some dramatic overcompensation or even profanity from the driver.
A failed driving rally roll moves the expedition further down the collision checklist.
The driver has lost control of the vehicle, and the dice are taking over the story.
Tension mounts even more.

== Loss of Control
*Failed Driving Roll and Rally Roll*

To arrive here, the player has lost both her driving roll and her rally roll.
The loss of control could be just plain unlucky, but the vehicle was going too fast more often.
Things are now getting dangerous.
Loss of control of the vehicle allows it to travel in a somewhat random direction.
The loss of control is temporary, and if there still is a chance that no collision will occur.

.*Elements of Loss of Control*
. Duration
. Deceleration
. Direction

=== Duration
The loss of control of the vehicle will last for 0 to 3 units (1d4-1).
The driver loses control of her vehicle for that duration of time.

If the vehicle is travelling ten h/u and loses control for three units, the vehicle will travel for 30 hexes out of control.

Deceleration and deviation simulate the vehicle careening out of control every unit. 
This period is when everyone in the vehicle is screaming in fear, especially the nothing personas.

==== Duration of Loss of Control
.Duration = 1d4-1 units (0-3 units)
****
A result of  0  indicates this unit only.  +
A result of 3 indicates this unit and the next two.
****

=== Deceleration
This speed loss can be from sensible braking, mad deviations, or both.
While the driver is trying to regain control of the vehicle, the most common reaction is to brake.
Swerving around also wastes energy, and a vehicle out of control *always*  slows down.

The vehicle will decrease its speed by 0%-50% (1d6-1) each unit of lost control.
A 0% deceleration indicates no loss of vehicle speed.
A 50% deceleration indicates that the vehicle will be travelling at half its original speed.

The deceleration can be quite hazardous to the passengers if they lack proper restraints (aka seat belts).
The decelerated speed is the one that determines the damage if an accident should result.

==== Deceleration In Loss of Control
.Deceleration = 1d46-1 times 10%
****
A 1d6 result of 1 =  0% deceleration. + 
A 1d6 result of 3 = 20% deceleration.
****

=== Direction
The struggle to control the vehicle is real.
Once control is lost, the vehicle careens in a random direction.
The last one, deviation, is left to the discretion of the referee.
The ref must decide whether the vehicle-deviates left, right, up or down.

== Collision Check
Losing control of a vehicle may result in a collision.
A collision can occur if the loss of control causes the vehicle to crash into an obstacle or careen off the road.

.*Collision Indicated*
* loss of control path crosses:
** another vehicle's path
** an obstacle
** goes off the road
* change of grade by >1/2 a hex
* confined space with no other option
* parameters decided by the referee

include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

== Collision Damage 
The deadliness of a crash depends on the speed of the vehicle.
The higher the speed, the more dangerous the collision.
The speed of the collision determines the energy of the collision.
The energy of the collision determines the amount of damage delivered.
The vehicle and passengers are damaged simultaneously.

NOTE: *Driving is safe. Crashing is dangerous.*

=== Speed
The speed at which the vehicle collides determines the severity of the accident.
The vehicle should use its decelerated speed as the collision speed.
If there are multiple vehicles in the collision, the speeds of both vehicles come into play.
The vehicle speeds are combined to inflict damage to both vehicles.

.*Relative Speeds*
. Head-on collision (front three  facets): add speeds together
. Rear-end collision (back three facets): subtract speeds
. T-bone collision (side facets): Use the higher speed 

include::uncombat:partial$inatmo_collision_damage.adoc[]

=== Wate
Speed indicates the energy delivered by a collision, but that is not the whole picture.
The relative wates involved in the collision also affect the damage delivered.
If the referee ignores relative wates, the referee can expect strange results.
For example, a moped could ram an 80-ton military tank at high speed and kill the tank crew.
Or a jet plane could crash into a convertible, and the car driver could escape injury.
There are some faux Newtonian solutions to these potential problems.

==== Collision Wate Multiplier
.Damage Multiplier = Larger vehicle wate / Smaller vehicle wate  
****
The multiplier cannot exceed four times or one-quarter.
****

If a 1200 kg vehicle collides with a 400 kg vehicle, the larger vehicle will take 1/3 damage. 
The smaller vehicle will take three times damage.
The referee should round the damage multiplier to the nearest manageable number (1, 2, 3, 4) or (1, 1/2, 1/3. 1/4).
The damage factor cannot be increased more than four times greater or be reduced by less than 1/4.

== Persona Damage
Collisions can deliver massive amounts of damage and easily kill personas.
Collision damage works the same as any other damage inflicted on the persona.
The referee generates the damage, and the player subtracts the value from her hit points.
The referee can roll damage once for all the personas in the collision or individually for each persona.

Every persona involved in the collision takes the HPS damage.
If two vehicles collide, then all the personas in both vehicles take damage.
In a collision at 35 h/u, every passenger in both vehicles takes 6d10 HPS in damage.
Relative wate can increase the damage by up to 4 times or decrease it by 1/4.

Pedestrians hit by vehicles will take damage as if they were in an accident with the vehicle.
A vehicle travelling 35 h/u would do 6d10 to a pedestrian.

=== Unrestrained Personas
A deceleration of 50% will damage unrestrained passengers.
Being savagely thrown about in a vehicle could happen without a collision.
For instance, a vehicle that decelerates to 50 h/u from 100 h/u will throw unrestrained passengers around inside the vehicle.
Personas can hit the interior bulkheads at 50 h/u.
Bright explorers wear their seat belts!!

== Vehicle Damage
Vehicles do not have hit points.
Vehicles suffer damage in a fashion similar to other inorganic objects.
Vehicle damage resembles robot, spacecraft, and artifact damage.
The higher the speed of the vehicle has its collision at the more damage that it endures.

A vehicle in a collision at eight h/u will not sustain damage, but the passengers may.
A vehicle in a collision at 28 h/u would sustain three vehicle damage table rolls.
A vehicle that collides at 60 h/u (250 km/h) would take six damage table rolls.

Each vehicle damage roll indicates a location of damage and the extent of the damage. 
The location of the damage is entirely random. 
The extent of damage can be random or modified depending on the irritation level of the referee.

=== Location of Vehicle Damage
A roll on the Location of Vehicle Damage table must include an Extent of Damage roll.
The location of damage determines which vehicle function is affected by the damage.

include::combat:partial$damage_location_inatmo_vehicle.adoc[]

=== Extent of Vehicle Damage
The extent of the damage roll indicates the decrease in efficiency of the damaged part.
Major damage would decrease the system to 60% of the previous function.
Major damage to the speed system would reduce the vehicle's speed to 60% of the previous function.
The vehicle's maximum speed of 30 h/u drops to 18 h/u.
Vehicle system damage is cumulative.

include::combat:partial$exatmo_vehicle_damage_amount.adoc[]

The Collision Wate Modifier should modify the extent of the damage.
The referee may multiply the extent of damage roll by the multiplier.
If the player rolls 50 on the Extent of Damage Table, this could be multiplied by as much as 4 or 1/4.

=== Further Complications
There are further complications that may interest the referee.
Passenger entrapment equals 1% per HPS of damage inflicted on the passenger.
Post-collision fire is dependent on fuel type and damage to the fuel system.
A xref:uncombat:sphincter_rolls.adoc[Sphincter Roll,window=_blank] is required to determine if there is a fire complication.
Whether the vehicle is drivable depends on the damage to systems during the collision.
The final vehicle resting position is entirely up to the decision of the referee.

== Hex Mat
Vehicles travel at tremendous speeds.
Most vehicles will run out of tabletop combat mat in a unit or two.
Vehicle racing, or chasing, is another reason to keep track of vehicle location.
Car chases are fun.
If there are no persona tokens on the mat, grab a smaller scale hex mat.
The smaller scale mat allows for high-speed maneuvers and treacherous obstacles.
Regardless of the scale of the hex mat, vehicles move like any other persona.
They cover way more hexes every unit and can have lethal collisions.
