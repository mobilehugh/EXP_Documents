= Task Rolls

Task rolls are made by players when their persona is attempting something.
The task roll is a check for success. 
If the player wins the task roll, her persona has succeeded at the something.

NOTE: *Task Rolls have replaced Performance Tables from previous versions.*

Tasks can be mundane, like trying to repair a vehicle engine.
Other tasks are pure sciency fiction, like strapping a grommet-sized oscillating refractometer onto a Fredericton di-collating time re-modulator.
Task rolls are used for vocation skills, abilities and gifts as well. 
Task rolls do not cover driving. 
There is an entire section devoted to xref:uncombat:driving.adoc[Driving,window=_blank].

The more complex the task, the more difficult it is to succeed.
Every task has its degree of difficulty (DD).
The more complex the task, the higher the difficulty, and the higher the DD, the higher the task roll required to succeed.

Sometimes a task will be too difficult for one persona to complete on their own. 
<<_research_teams,Research Teams>> are crucial to completing highly complicated tasks.

. <<_difficulty,Determine Difficulty>>
. <<_target_roll,Determine Target Roll>>
. <<_bonuses,Determine Bonuses>>
. <<_make_the_roll,Make the Roll>>

=== Competency
The Competency is a combination of the persona's EXPS Level and her skills.
A persona can use her EXPS Level for any task that fits within her vocation.
If the persona also has an applicable skill, she can add this to her Competency.

If the persona does not have aptitude in the task area they cannot have competence. 
Aptitude can be as simple as staying in your vocation's lane, or more nuanced.
For a more nuanced view jump to <<_aptitude,Aptitude>>.

==== Calculation
.Competency = EXPS Level + Interests + Skills * 2
****
3rd biologist Research interest 1, Herbivore skill 2 +
Competency 6 studying herbivores. 
****

// lots of examples to add here

=== Difficulty
The more complicated something is the higher the Degree of Difficulty (DD).
Almost every task has a degree of difficulty associated with it.
While the lowest DD possible is 1 there is no limit to how high a DD can go.
However, the DD can be so high that it is impossible to win the Task Roll.
For example, cloning is a DD 42 task. 

If a task does not exist or there is no assigned degree of difficulty, the players and referee must negotiate one.
The players and referee only need to agree on a qualitative term describing the difficulty of the task.
A dice roll will randomly determine the actual value of the DD.

Let's consider a persona that wants to make some ice from water.
If there is a freezer, this task should be automatic, but there may be some trivial interference.
So the referee and players agree that this is task has a trivial difficulty.
If there is no freezer, and the expedition is on a hot planet where the water is full of sediment, the difficulty should be impossible or bizarre.

=== Target Roll
The target roll is the actual number that the player must roll higher than to win the task roll.
The target roll is like the Defence Rating of a task.
The player must roll equal to or higher than the target roll.
The higher the persona's skill score (EXPS level plus skills), the lower the target roll.
The higher the task's degree of difficulty, the higher the target roll.

The target roll can be tabulated or calculated.
A tabulated target roll employs a table comparing the degree of difficulty to skill score. 
A calculated target roll employs simple maths to determine the target roll.
Very high skill scores and very high DDs require calculation.

==== Tabulated
No calculations are required.
Compare DD to skill score to get the target roll.
For example, skill score 5 intersects with DD 5 to yield a target roll of 66.
The player must roll 66 or higher on a 1d100 to win her task roll.
The higher the persona's skill score, the lower the player's target roll.
Very high skill scores and very high DDs exceed the Target Rolls Table's limits and require calculation.

Table needs a bigger page.
Jump to the xref:uncombat:task_target_tabulated.adoc[Task Target Table]

==== Calculated
Players can calculate the target roll using some simple maths and a tiny table.
The higher the skill score, the greater the impact on the target roll.
Using the <<_tabulated,table>> is much faster.

.Data Needed
. Difficulty (DD)
. Competency (Comp)
. Aptitude 

Difficulty and competency are needed.
Aptitude refers to how close the task is to th

A persona with no aptitude indicates that a persona is attempting a task out of her vocation.
For example, a mercenary trying to identify an alien flower would have no aptitude. 

include::uncombat:partial$task_aptitude_competency_multiplier.adoc[]

==== Target Roll Calculation
.Target Roll = 56 + (4 * DD) - (Skill Score * Multiplier)
****
DD 10 vs Comp 8 = 56 + (4 * 10) - (8 * 2) = 56 + 40 - 16 = 80 +
DD 6 vs Comp 11 = 56 + (4 * 6) - (11 * 3) = 56 + 24 - 33 = 47 +
DD 30 vs Comp 9 = 56 + (4 * 30) - (9 * 2) = 56 + 120 - 18 = 158 +
DD 2 vs Comp 18 = 56 + (4 * 2) - (18 *4) = 56 + 8 - 64 = -8
****

=== Bonuses
The player adds bonuses to her 1d100 roll.
Bonuses often mean the difference between success and failure.
Bonuses can come from every which way.
Some TOYs give task roll bonuses.
Some computers give task roll bonuses.
Many referees will offer task roll bonuses for good role-playing descriptions.

==== Attribute Bonuses
The most common bonuses are vocation attribute bonuses.
If the task fits into the vocation's aptitude, the player can add an attribute to the 1d100 roll.
For combat tasks, mercenaries can add their STR.
For knowledge-based tasks, biologists can add their INT. 

include::uncombat:partial$vocation_attribute_bonus.adoc[]

==== Role Playing Bonuses
The more role-playing is integrated into the roll playing system, the more fun the play is.
Role-playing bonuses for task rolls incentivize fun descriptions from the players. 
The following are examples of player descriptions that should earn task roll bonuses.
 “I'm going to leaf through my notes here and try to identify this bizarre creature.” 
Or “I summon all the forces of evil beneath me, as I try to apply pressure to this weakling altruist.”
Or “Taking my favourite tools from my mechanical kit, I proceed to repair this damaged bicycle.”
Or “I  calmly stalk silently past the sleeping sentry.”

The role-playing bonuses should be small since role-playing has its benefit.
A good description could get a 1d4 bonus.
A description that rocks all the players may get a 1d10 bonus. 
Small bonuses that lead to success generate quite a bit of excitement.

=== Make the Roll
The player rolls the 1d100, adds in the bonuses and hopes to beat the target roll. 
Any roll equal to or higher than the target roll is a success.
Any roll less than the target roll is a failure.

== Aptitude
I can do that.

Often personas will want to accomplish a task that is not within the realm of their vocation.
Mercenaries often need the vet skills quick fix and stabilization.
A mechanic may want to to do spie stuff on a security system.

The cross vocation penalties are for individual personas trying to expand their scope of practice.
These degree of difficulty penalties are in addition to zeroing the skill score by lack of aptitude.
A Mechanic trying to use the knite gift energy would face a DD of 45 and have zero skill score (target roll of 236).
The same mechanic trying to use the nothing skill of righteous indignation would have a DD of 4-9 and zero skill score (target roll from 72 to 92).

include::uncombat:partial$task_vocation_lanes.adoc[]

== Research Teams
Research teams allow groups of personas to pool their experience skills for a greater chance of success.
Several mechanics may share their expertise to solve a scientific problem or repair a broken warp drive.
A  team of veterinarians could work together to save a life.
The skill score of a research team is the sum of the skill scores of all its members.
Every player with a persona on the research team gets to make a task roll using the team's combined skill score.
If any of the players win their task roll, then the entire team is successful.

include::ROOT:partial$articulate.adoc[]

=== Composition
Every research team must have a team leader.
The EXPS Level of the team leader determines the size of the research team.
The team can consist of one persona per level of the team leader in addition to themselves.
A team leader cannot lead a persona with a higher EXPS level than herself.

For example, a 5th level veterinarian could lead a team of 5 veterinarians.
That could be a combined research team of skill score 30 with five five task rolls.
Teams can accomplish amazing things.
However, teams cannot get together to solve intricate campaign puzzles created by the referee.
As always, plot points are dice roll resistant.

A team can be composed of different vocations.
The players must justify each vocation type's involvement on the research team.
For example, a 7th level biologist could lead a team of 5 biologists, a mercenary, and a spie.
If the research team was trying to determine the chance of alien revolution, this team makes sense.
If the research team were trying to determine the direction of alien migration, including the spie and mercenary would not make sense.

=== Example
An operating room research team has a 4th level veterinarian team leader.
The team comprises two 3rd level vets, a 3rd level biologist and a 2nd level nomad.
They are working together to fix a famous alien the expedition accidentally ran over with a hovercar.
They need to repair her articulated wing flaps. 
The Degree of Difficulty of the procedure is 20DD.

The research team's total skill score is 15 (4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2).

Each team member would get a chance to beat the Target Roll of 76.
The procedure is a success if any of the five players roll 76 or higher.

== Task Duration
How long a task takes depends on a combination of common sense and degree of difficulty (DD).
Some tasks have specifically assigned durations.
Performing open-heart surgery (a difficult task) would always take longer than ten minutes.
However, the equally difficult task of performing a double somersault would take an instant.

Combat-related tasks happen during the unit of combat unless otherwise specified.
Research teamwork that requires months can pass in an instant with a few task rolls.

include::uncombat:partial$task_durations.adoc[]

A persona carrying out a 4 DD task would require 0-99 units of time.
At the end of which, the player would make her task roll.
Most of the time, this duration information is a nerd fascination.
If time is not of the essence, then don't play on this table. 
During combat time, these durations may be critical.
Outside of combat time, the task durations pass instantly.

A biologist trying to identify an alien species could take up to 3 minutes to make a decision.
The duration reflects the time she spent leafing through her notes and observing before making a decision.

A mercenary attempting pistol with pistol ambidextrous combat would have no such time duration, and success, or failure, is instantaneous.

NOTE: *A task roll is won in an instant, but the research and prep may take months.*

Research teams should always check for the duration of tasks. 
A task that takes months to complete could be reflected in gameplay with sub-missions to get materials or other team members.

== Example Tasks
This list is not exhaustive. 
The most common kinds of tasks encountered play testing EXP for a decade are listed here.
Many are silly. 

Successful Task Rolls are granular and represent dice rolls that change a session, not a campaign.
As with all dice rolls in the Roll Playing System, a successful task should not change a campaign's course.
Plot points are highly resistant to dice rolls. 

IMPORTANT: *These tables are not exhaustive.*

=== General 
General tasks represent day-to-day things that personas may want to do.
Under normal circumstances, there should be no task roll required for these actions.
The referee would need some fun excuse to force the player to make a task roll.
If a persona needs to bake a cake for her dessert, she should simply bake a cake.
If the persona is baking a cake to impress an alien dignitary, then a task roll is part of the fun.
If the persona needs to bake a cake after drinking a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaphod_Beeblebrox#Pan-Galactic_Gargle_Blaster[uncombat:task_rolls.adoc], then a task roll is part of the fun.
