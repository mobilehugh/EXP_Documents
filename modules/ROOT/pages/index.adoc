== RPG Nerd Pitch
* EXP is a heavily play tested, rigorously edited, RPG on its 7th version
* EXP has a history that stretches from a 1970s homebrew to yesterday's git push
* Settle combat with a tactical war game like system or a story based theatrical one
** the tactical system uses a xref:roll_playing_system:kilo_die_mechanic.adoc[kilodie mechanic], to allow for highly granular combat tuning.
** the theatrical system uses a xref:role_playing_system:four_dee_two_mechanic.adoc[4D2 mechanic], to create descriptive narrative outcomes
* Randomly generate fleshed out personas with dice rolls galore, or not
* Persona, vocations, combat, toys and mythos are integrated
* The ruleset is resilient and detail can be shed without collapsing playability

== Data Nerd Pitch
* EXP has https://github.com/mobilehugh/EXP_Game_Tools[automation tools] for generating referee personas
